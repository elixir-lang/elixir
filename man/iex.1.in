.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar OPTIONS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The interactive shell is used for evaluation, debugging and introspection of the Elixir runtime system. It is also possible to use the program for testing the work of small pieces of code escaping the stage of saving the code in a file.
.Sh OPTIONS
Note that many of the options mentioned here were borrowed from the Erlang shell, therefore
.Xr erl 1
can be used as an additional source of information on the options.

.Pq see above .
If the file doesn't exist when a node starts, it will be created.
.It Pa .iex.exs
After
.Nm
starts, it seeks the file
.Pa .iex.exs
and, in a case of success, executes the code from the file in the context of the shell. At first the search starts in the current working directory, then, if necessary, it continues in the home directory.
