# Release process

## All releases

This document simply outlines the release process:

1. Ensure you are running on the oldest supported Erlang version

2. Remove all `-dev` extension from versions (see below for all files)

3. Ensure CHANGELOG is updated and add the current date

4. Update "Compatibility and Deprecations" if a new OTP version is supported. If a new `vMAJOR.MINOR`, update **all** tables in the page

5. If a new `vMAJOR.MINOR`, create a new branch "vMAJOR.MINOR" and set `CANONICAL=` in Makefile

6. Commit changes above with title "Release vVERSION" and generate a new tag

7. Run `make clean test` to ensure all tests pass from scratch and the CI is green

8. Recompile an existing project (for example, Ecto) to ensure manifests can be upgraded

9. Push branch and the new tag

10. Publish new zips with `make zips`, upload `Precompiled.zip` and `Docs.zip` to GitHub Releases

11. Add the release to `elixir.csv` and `_data/elixir-versions.yml` files in `elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com`

12. After a new `vMAJOR.MINOR`, move back to master, bump versions, start new CHANGELOG, add `-dev` back and commit "Start vMAJOR.MINOR+1"
