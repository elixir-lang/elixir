# Release process

This document simply outlines the release process:

1) Remove `-dev` extension from VERSION

2) Ensure CHANGELOG is updated and timestamp

3) Commit changes above with title "Release vVERSION" and generate new tag

4) Run `make clean test` to ensure all tests pass from scratch and the CI is green

5) Push master and tags

6) Release new docs with `make release_docs`, move docs to `docs/stable`

7) Release new zip with `make release_zip`, push new zip to GitHub Releases

8) Merge master into stable branch and push it

9) After release, bump versions, add `-dev` back and commit

10) `make release_docs` once again and push it to `elixir-lang.github.com`
