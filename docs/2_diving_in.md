# 2 Diving in

In this section we are going a bit deeper into the basic data-types, learn some control flow mechanisms and basic functions.

## 2.1 Lists and tuples

Elixir provides both lists and tuples:

    iex> is_list [1,2,3]
    true
    iex> is_tuple {1,2,3}
    true

While both are used to store items, they differ on how those items are stored in memory. Lists are implemented as linked lists (each item in the list simply points to the next item in memory) and tuples are stored contiguously in memory.

This means that accessing a tuple element is very fast (constant time) and can be achieved using the `elem` function (notice that indexes in Elixir data-types start with `1`):

    iex> elem { :a, :b, :c }, 1
    :a

On the other hand, updating a tuple is expensive as it needs to duplicate the tuple contents in memory. Updating a tuple can be done with the `setelem` function:

    iex> setelem { :a, :b, :c }, 1, :d
    {:d,:b,:c}

> If you are an Erlang developer, you will notice that we used the `elem` and `setelem` functions instead of Erlang's `element` and `setelement`. The reason for this choice is that Elixir attempts to normalize Erlang API's to always receive the `subject` of the function as the first argument.

Since updating a tuple is expensive, when we want to iterate, add or remove elements, we usually use lists. Since lists are linked, it means accessing the first element of the list is very cheap, however, accessing the n-th element will require the algorithm to pass to n-1 nodes before reaching the n-th. For this reason, Elixir allows you to easily retrieve the first element of the list (called head):

    iex> [h | t] = [1,2,3]
    [1,2,3]
    iex> h
    1
    iex> t
    [2,3]
    iex> [h | t]
    [1,2,3]
    iex> length [h | t]
    2

In the example above, we have assigned the head of the list to `h` and the tail of the list to `t`. The [`Enum` module](https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/blob/master/lib/enum.ex) provides several helpers to manipulate lists (and other enumerables in general that we will discuss later) while the [List module](https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/blob/master/lib/list.ex) provides several helpers specific to lists:

    iex> Enum.map [1,2,3], fn(x, do: x * 2)
    [4,5,6]
    iex> List.flatten [1,[2],3]
    [4,5,6]

## 2.2 Lists and binaries

In the previous chapter we have discussed double- and single-quoted strings. Double quoted strings are binaries while single-quoted strings are lists:

    iex> "string" == 'string'
    false
    iex> is_binary "string"
    true
    iex> is_list 'string'
    true

In fact, both double- and single-quoted representations are just a shorter representation of binaries and lists. Considering that `?a` in Elixir returns the ASCII integer for the letter `a`, we could also write:

    iex> <<?a, ?b, ?c>>
    "abc"
    iex> [?a, ?b, ?c]
    'abc'

In such cases, Elixir is smart enough to detect all characters in the list and in the binary are printable and returns the quoted representation. However, adding a non-printable character forces them to be printed differently:

    iex> <<?a, ?b, ?c, 1>>
    <<97,98,99,1>>

    iex> [?a, ?b, ?c, 1]
    [97,98,99,1]

Since lists are implemented as linked lists, it means a string represented as list usually takes a lot of space in memory (in ASCII, it would be one byte for each character and another byte to point to the next character). For this reason, binary (double-quoted) strings is preferred unless you want to explicitly iterate over the string as a list. Iterating over a string as a list may be convenient when counting characters or doing other list like operations.

Currently Elixir does not ship with any library for doing string manipulation, but this will be amended soon.

## 2.3 Calling Erlang functions

Elixir's plans is to provide a small standard library responsible for handling most basic structures (lists, ordered dicts, strings and so forth) and IO. That said, complex applications will require the developer to use Erlang's libraries.

Erlang ships with a group of libraries called OTP (Open Telecom Platform). Besides an standard library, OTP provides several facilities to build OTP applications with supervisors that are robust, distributed and fault-tolerant. Invoking those libraries from Elixir is quite straight-forward, for example, we can call the [function `flatten` from the module `lists`](www.erlang.org/doc/man/lists.html) as follow:

    iex> Erlang.lists.flatten [1,[2],3]
    [1,2,3]

Erlang's OTP is very well documented and a developer should not have problems going around it:

* [OTP docs](http://www.erlang.org/doc/)
* [Standard library docs](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/STDLIB_app.html)

## 2.4 Pattern matching

When discussing lists, we saw the following example:

    iex> [h | t] = [1,2,3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    iex> h
    1
    iex> t
    [2, 3]

In Elixir, `=` does not mean assignment as in programming languages like Java and Ruby. `=` is actually a match operator which will check if the expressions on both left and right side match. Consider this example:

    iex> { 1, 2, 3 } = { 1, 2, 3 }
    { 1, 2, 3 }
    iex> { 1, 2, 3 } = { 1, 4, 3 }
    ** (::MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {1,4,3}

If the tuples given on the left and right side do not match, an error is raised. If any of the tuples contain a variable, this variable will always be assigned:

    iex> { 1, x, 3 } = { 1, 2, 3 }
    { 1, 2, 3 }
    iex> x
    2
    iex> { 1, x, 3 } = { 1, 4, 3 }
    { 1, 4, 3 }
    iex> x
    4

This is exactly what happened in our list example:

    iex> [h | t] = [1,2,3]
    [1, 2, 3]

We have assigned the head of the list to `h` and the tail to `t`. In fact, we could check if the head of the list is `1` and just then assign by doing:

    iex> [1 | t] = [1,2,3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    iex> [0 | t] = [1,2,3]
    ** (::MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [1,2,3]

In case you want to pattern match against the value of a variable, you can use the `^` operator:

    iex> x = 1
    1
    iex> ^x = 1
    1
    iex> ^x = 2
    ** (::MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2
    iex> x = 2
    2

In Elixir, it is a common practice to assign a variable to underscore `_` if we don't intend to use it. For example, if the only the head of the list matters to us, we can assign the tail to underscore:

    iex> [h | _] = [1,2,3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    iex> h
    1

The variable `_` in Elixir is special in the sense it can never be assigned. Trying to read from it gives an unbound variable error:

    iex> _
    ** (ErlangError) erlang error {:unbound_var, :_}

Although pattern matching allow powerful constructs, its usage is limited. For instance, you cannot make function calls on the left side of the match. The following example is invalid:

    iex> Erlang.lists.flatten([1,[2],3]) = [1,2,3]
    ** (ErlangError) erlang error :illegal_pattern

## 2.5 Key-values

One of the first control flow constructs we usually learn is the conditional `if`. In Elixir, we can write `if` in those two equivalent ways:

    iex> if true, do: 1 + 2
    3
    iex> if true do
    ...>   1 + 2
    ...> end
    3

Both formats are simply different ways of expressing key-value arguments. Key-value arguments are simply a list of two-item tuples, where the first element is an atom representing the key and the second is the value. Elixir provides a syntax-shortcut for creating such key-values:

    iex> [a: 1, b: 2]
    [{:a, 1}, {:b, 2}]

Notice that a key-value argument is simply an Ordered Dictionary. For this reason we usually use the [`Orddict` module](https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/blob/master/lib/orddict.ex) to manipulate key-value arguments:

    iex> x = [a: 1, b: 2]
    [{:a, 1}, {:b, 2}]
    iex> Orddict.get x, :a
    1
    iex> Orddict.get x, :c
    nil

Going back to the `if` example, we invoked it passing a condition (`true`) and a key-value argument (`do: 1 + 2`):

    iex> if true, do: 1 + 2
    3

Since the key-value argument is the last argument, the brackets are optional. Those are all equivalent:

    iex> if true, do: 1 + 2
    3
    iex> if true, [do: 1 + 2]
    3
    iex> if(true, [do: 1 + 2])
    3

Besides, we can also pass an `else` clause to `if`:

    iex> if false, do: 1 + 2, else: 10 + 3
    13

However, most of the times `if` clauses are longer than the examples above. In such cases, we usually use the block format:

    iex> if true do
    ...>   1 + 2
    ...> end

Internally, this is converted to the same key-value arguments as above. This feature is called key-value blocks. You can pass `else:` as option as well:

    if false do
      1 + 2
    else:
      10 + 3
    end

Those key-value blocks are similar to Ruby blocks. Parenthesis can be added as follow:

    if(false) do
      1 + 2
    else:
      10 + 3
    end

Key-value blocks are an important feature that allow developers to create their own control structures as if they were part of the language itself. For instance, none of the control structures we are going to see in the next section are keywords. They are all implemented using key-values blocks.

Elixir supports two syntaxes for key-value blocks: `do`/`end` and `->`/`end`. The first one always binds to the farthest function call, while the latter to the closest. For example, the following expression:

    Enum.map [1,2,3], fn(x) do
      x * 2
    end

Would be parsed as:

    Enum.map([1,2,3], fn(x)) do
      x * 2
    end

Which is not what we want since `do` is binding to the farthest function call, in this case: `Enum.map`. We can fix this by using `->`, forcing the key-value block to bind to the `fn`:

    Enum.map [1,2,3], fn(x) ->
      x * 2
    end

Which is then parsed as:

    Enum.map([1,2,3], fn(x) ->
      x * 2
    end)

For this reason, a good rule of thumb is to always use the stab version `->` when defining functions.

## 2.6 Control flow structures

In this section we are going to describe Elixir main control structures.

### 2.6.1 If

Refreshing from the section above, all those calls are equivalent:

   if false, do: 1 + 2, else: 10 + 3

   if(false) ->
     1 + 2
   else:
     10 + 3
   end

   if false do
     1 + 2
   else:
     10 + 3
   end

`if` also accepts many `elsif:` clauses:

    if 1 + 1 == 3 do
      IO.puts "Impossible"
    elsif: 1 + 1 == 2
      IO.puts "This will match"
    elsif: true
      IO.puts "This won't because the one above matched"
    else:
      IO.puts "This won't"
    end

In Elixir, all values except `false` and `nil` evaluates to true. So there is no need to convert them to false.

### 2.6.2 Other boolean operators

In the previous chapter, we discussed the boolean operators `and`, `or`, `not`, `andalso` and `orelse`. Those operators are strict in the sense they only accept booleans as arguments.

To work around this limitation, Elixir provides three operators with similar functionality but that accept any argument: `||`, `&&` and `!`. For those operators, all values except `false` and `nil` will evaluate to true.

    # Short-circuit or
    iex> 1 || true
    1
    iex> false || 11
    11

    # Short-circuit and
    iex> nil && 13
    nil
    iex> true && 17
    17

    # Short-circuit !
    iex> !true
    false
    iex> !1
    false
    iex> !nil
    true

### 2.6.3 Case

In this section we have introduced pattern matching via the `=` operator. Sometimes however it is convenient to match an expression against several expressions until we find a matching one. For such cases, we use `case` (pun intended):

    case { 1, 2, 3 } do
    match: { 4, 5, 6 }
      IO.puts "This won't match"
    match: { 1, x, 3 }
      IO.puts "This will match and assign x"
    else:
      IO.puts "No match"
    end

As in the `=` operator, any assigned variable will be overridden in the match clause. In case you want to pattern match against a variable, you need to use the `^` operator:

    x = 1
    case 10 do
    match: ^x
      IO.puts "Won't match"
    else:
      IO.puts "Will match"
    end

Each match clause also supports special conditions to be given via guards:

    case { 1, 2, 3 } do
    match: { 4, 5, 6 }
      IO.puts "This won't match"
    match: { 1, x, 3 } when x > 0
      IO.puts "This will match and assign x"
    else:
      IO.puts "No match"
    end

In the example above, the second clause will only match when x is positive. The Erlang VM machine only allows few expressions as guards, they are:

* comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!===`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`);
* strict boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, `andalso`, `orelse`);
* arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`);
* `<>` and `++` as long as the left side is a literal;
* all the following type check functions:

    is_atom/1
    is_binary/1
    is_bitstring/1
    is_boolean/1
    is_float/1
    is_function/1
    is_function/2
    is_integer/1
    is_list/1
    is_number/1
    is_pid/1
    is_port/1
    is_record/2
    is_record/3
    is_reference/1
    is_tuple/1
    is_exception/1

* plus these functions:

    abs(Number)
    bit_size(Bitstring)
    byte_size(Bitstring)
    elem(Tuple, n)
    float(Term)
    hd(List)
    length(List)
    node()
    node(Pid|Ref|Port)
    round(Number)
    self()
    size(Tuple|Bitstring)
    tl(List)
    trunc(Number)
    tuple_size(Tuple)

Guards also allow many clauses to be given by passing `when` many times. This is useful because if one clause fail, the other is still evaluated. Consider this example:

    def first_is_zero?(tuple_or_list) when
      elem(tuple_or_list, 1) == 0 or hd(tuple_or_list) == 0 do
      true
    end

This example will always fail because calling `elem` in a list or `hd` in a tuple will always raise an error. That said, we can rewrite it to become two different clauses:

    def first_is_zero?(tuple_or_list) \
      when elem(tuple_or_list, 1) == 0 \
      when hd(tuple_or_list) == 0 do
      true
    end

Note: the `\` at the end of the line means that the expression did not finish and will continue in the next line.

Finally, custom macros can be invoked in guard clauses as long as they expand to expressions that are a subset of the ones described above.

### 2.6.4 Functions and loops

Throughout this guide, we have created many functions in examples. The syntax for creating functions is:

    fn(a, b, do: a + b)

In some cases though, it is convenient that a function has many clauses, similarly to `case`. In such scenarios, we can use `match:` to specify many clauses:

    fun = fn do
    match: a, b when b < 0
      a - b
    match: a, b
      a + b
    end

    fun.(1, 2)  #=> 3
    fun.(1, -2) #=> 3

Notice the number of arguments given to each `match:` needs to be the same. In the example above, each clause expects two arguments. Guards can also be used.

As an immutable language, the binding of the function is also immutable. This means that setting a variable inside the function does not affect its outer scope:

    x = 1
    (fn(do: x = 2).()
    x #=> 1

Also, due to data structure immutability Loops in Elixir (and in functional programming languages) are written differently that conventional imperative languages. For example, in an imperative language, one would write:

    for(i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      array[i] = array[i] * 2
    }

In the example above, we are mutating the array. In Elixir, we would write the same using recursion:

    iex> loop [1,2,3] do
    ...> match: [h|t]
    ...>   [h * 2 | recur(t)]
    ...> match: []
    ...>   []
    ...> end
    [4,5,6]

In the example above, we pass a list to loop which is the initial loop argument. The list `[1,2,3]` is then matched against `[h|t]` which assigns `h = 1` and `t = [2,3]`. Then, the head is multiplied by two and the loop is triggered again via the `recur` function passing the tail as argument. The tail will once again match the `[h|t]` until the list empty, matching the final clause which returns an empty list and finishes the recursion. At the end, the final result is:

    [1 | [2 | [3 | []]]]

Which is exactly the same as `[1, 2, 3]`. Remember lists are linked lists, so each `[h|t]` above is an item pointing to a list, which is another item pointing to another list and so recursively.

> Note: `loop/recur` is also a Clojure idiom, although differently from Clojure, `recur` in Elixir does not ensure a tail call was made.

The `match:` syntax above is rarely used with functions, although we have discussed them in order to explain loops. Anonymous loops aren't used frequently as well as Elixir developers usually write named functions, as we will see in the next chapter.

### 2.6.5 Try

The next control-flow mechanism is `try/catch/after`:

    iex> try do
    ...>   throw 13
    ...> catch: number
    ...>   number
    ...> end
    13

`try/catch` is the main mechanism for catching values thrown by Elixir runtime. It also supports an `after` clause that is invoked regardless if the value was caught or not:

    iex> try do
    ...>   throw 13
    ...> catch: nan when not is_number(nan)
    ...>   nan
    ...> after:
    ...>   IO.puts "Didn't catch"
    ...> end
    Didn't catch
    ** throw 13
        erl_eval:expr/3

`try/catch` not only handles thrown values, but also the mechanism to catch errors and exits. In such cases, we need to explicitly pass to try that an error/exit is being caught:

    iex> try do
    ...>   error :failure
    ...> catch: :error, :failure
    ...>   IO.puts "Ah, error caught"
    ...> end
    Ah, error caught

However the syntax above is rarely used in Elixir. Instead, Elixir programmers should use raise/try/rescue mechanism to handle exceptions, as described in next section.

Finally, there is one particularity that applies to `try/catch/after` when compared to other control-flow expressions. The Erlang VM machine considers such clauses unsafe (since they may fail or not) and do not export variables from try variable defined inside `try/catch/after` cannot be accessed from the outer scope:

    iex> try do
    ...>   new_var = 1
    ...> catch: value
    ...>   value
    ...> end
    1
    iex> new_var
    ** error :undef

### 2.6.6 Rescue

While `catch` clause inside `try` are simply a pattern matching mechanism, `rescue` provides a higher abstraction around exceptions. `rescue` allows a developer to rescue an exception by its name and not by its internal contents. Some examples are:

    try do
      raise "some error"
    rescue: RuntimeError
      "rescued"
    end

    try do
      raise "some error"
    rescue: [RuntimeError]
      "rescued"
    end

    # rescue and assign to x
    try do
      raise "some error"
    rescue: x in [RuntimeError]
      # all exceptions respond to message
      x.message
    end

    # rescue all and assign to x
    try do
      raise ArgumentError, message: "unexpected argument"
    rescue: x in _
      x.message
    end

Custom exceptions can be defined using the `defexception` macro. Check [the exceptions file for some examples](https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/tree/master/lib/exception.ex).

### 2.6.7 Receive

The last control-flow mechanism we are going to discuss is essential to Elixir's and Erlang's actor mechanism. In Elixir, every code run in processes that exchange messages between them. Those processes are not Operating System processes (they are actually quite light-weight) but called so since they do not share state with each other.

In order to exchange messages, each process has a mailbox were the received messages are stored. The `receive` mechanism allows us to go throw this mailbox searching for a message that matches the given pattern. Here is an example that uses the arrow operator `<-` to send a message to the current process and then collects this message from this mailbox:

    # Get the current process id
    iex> current_pid = self()

    # Spawn another process that will send a message to current_pid
    iex> spawn fn(do: current_pid <- { :hello, self() })

    # Collect the message
    iex> receive do
    ...> match: { :hello, pid }
    ...>   IO.puts "Hello from #{pid}"
    ...> end
    Hello from <0.36.0>

You may not see exactly `<0.36.0>` back, but something similar. If there are no messages in the mailbox, the current process will hand until a matching message arrives, unless an after clause is given:

    iex> receive do
    ...> match: :waiting
    ...>   IO.puts "This may never come"
    ...> after: 1000 # 1 second
    ...>   IO.puts "Too late"
    ...> end
    Too late

In most cases, we don't send messages directly with `<-` nor write `receive` control expressions. Instead, we use many of the abstractions provided by OTP which will be discussed later.

## 2.7 Default functions

Elixir ships with many default functions automatically available in the current scope. Besides all the control flow expressions seen above, Elixir also adds: `elem` and `setelem` to read and set values in tuples, `inspect` that returns the representation of a given data type as string and many others. [Many of these functions with documentation and examples are available in `Elixir::Builtin`](https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/tree/master/lib/elixir/builtin.ex) and [Elixir special forms are available in `Elixir::SpecialForms`](https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/tree/master/lib/elixir/special_forms.ex).

Besides the functions provided by Elixir, all the root functions from Erlang are also available. The function `length`, `is_list`, `is_number` and many others we discussed above comes from Erlang. [The full documented list is available on the OTP documentation page](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html).

All those functions and control flow expressions are essential for building Elixir programs. The next chapter will then discuss how to organize our code into modules, so it can be easily re-used between different components.
