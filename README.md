## Compiling from source

To run Elixir from source, clone this repository to your machine, compile and test it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir.git
cd elixir
make clean test
```

> Note: if you are running on Windows,
[this article includes important notes for compiling Elixir from source
on Windows](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/wiki/Windows).

If Elixir fails to build (specifically when pulling in a new version via
`git`), be sure to remove any previous build artifacts by running
`make clean`, then `make test`.

If tests pass, you are ready to move on to the [Getting Started guide][1]
or to try Interactive Elixir by running `bin/iex` in your terminal.

However, if tests fail, it is likely you have an outdated Erlang version
(Elixir requires Erlang 18.0 or later). You can check your Erlang version
by calling `erl` in the command line. You will see some information as follows:

    Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.0] [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

If you have properly set up your dependencies and tests still fail,
you may want to open up a bug report, as explained next.

## Bug reports

For reporting bugs, [visit our issues tracker][2] and follow the steps
for reporting a new issue. Please disclose security vulnerabilities
privately at elixir-security@googlegroups.com.

## Contributing

We welcome everyone to contribute to Elixir and help us tackle existing issues!
To do so, there are a few things you need to know about the code. First, Elixir
code is divided in applications inside the `lib` folder:

* `elixir` - Contains Elixir's kernel and stdlib

* `eex` - Template engine that allows you to embed Elixir

* `ex_unit` - Simple test framework that ships with Elixir

* `iex` - IEx, Elixir's interactive shell

* `logger` - The built-in logger

* `mix` - Elixir's build tool

You can run all tests in the root directory with `make test` and you can
also run tests for a specific framework `make test_#{NAME}`, for example,
`make test_ex_unit`.

In case you are changing a single file, you can compile and run tests only
for that particular file for fast development cycles. For example, if you
are changing the String module, you can compile it and run its tests as:

```sh
bin/elixirc lib/elixir/lib/string.ex -o lib/elixir/ebin
bin/elixir lib/elixir/test/elixir/string_test.exs
```

After your changes are done, please remember to run the full suite with
`make test`.

From time to time, your tests may fail in an existing Elixir checkout and
may require a clean start by running `make clean compile`. You can always
check [the official build status on Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-lang/elixir).

With tests running and passing, you are ready to contribute to Elixir and
[send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
We have saved some excellent pull requests we have received in the past in
case you are looking for some examples:

* [Implement Enum.member? – Pull Request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/992)
* [Add String.valid? – Pull Request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/1058)
* [Implement capture_io for ExUnit – Pull Request](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/1059)

We usually keep a list of enhancements and bugs [in the issue tracker][2].
For proposing new features, please start a discussion in the
[Elixir Core mailing list][3]. Keep in mind that it is your responsibility
to argue and explain why a feature is useful and how it will impact the
codebase and the community. Finally, remember all interactions in our official
spaces follow our [Code of Conduct][7].

### Reviewing changes

Once a pull request is sent, the Elixir team will review your changes.
We outline our process below to clarify the roles of everyone involved.

All pull requests must be approved by two committers before being merged into
the repository. In case any changes are necessary, the team will leave
appropriate comments requesting changes to the code.

The Elixir team may optionally assign someone to review a pull request.
In case someone is assigned, they must explicitly approve the code before
another team member can merge it.

When review is completed, your pull request will be squashed and merged
into the repository.

## Building documentation

Building the documentation requires [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
to be installed and built alongside Elixir:

```sh
# After cloning and compiling Elixir, in its parent directory:
git clone git://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc.git
cd ex_doc && ../elixir/bin/mix do deps.get, compile
cd ../elixir && make docs
```

This will produce documentation sets for `elixir`, `mix`, etc., under
the `doc` directory. If you are planning to contribute documentation,
[please check our best practices for writing documentation](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/writing-documentation.html).
