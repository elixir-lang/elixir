[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/elixir-lang/elixir.png?branch=master "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/elixir-lang/elixir)

For more about Elixir, installation and documentation, [check Elixir's website](http://elixir-lang.org/).

## Usage

If you want to contribute to Elixir or run it from source, clone this repository to your machine, compile and test it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir.git
    $ cd elixir
    $ make test

If tests pass, you are ready to move on to the [Getting Started guide][1] or to try Interactive Elixir by running: `bin/iex` in your terminal.

However, if tests fail, it is likely you have an outdated Erlang version (Elixir requires Erlang R16B or later). You can check your Erlang version by calling `erl` in the command line. You will see some information as follow:

    Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2] [rq:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

If you have the correct version and tests still fail, feel free to [open an issue][2].

## Building documentation

Building the documentation requires [ex_doc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) to be installed and built in the same containing folder as elixir.

    # After cloning and compiling Elixir
    $ git clone git://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc.git
    $ cd ../ex_doc && ../elixir/bin/mix compile
    $ cd ../elixir && make docs
