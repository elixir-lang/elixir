defmodule Function do
  @moduledoc """
  A set of functions for working with functions.

  Anonymous functions are typically created by using `fn`:

      iex> add = fn a, b -> a + b end
      iex> add.(1, 2)
      3

  It is also possible to capture module functions and pass them around
  as if they were anonymous functions by using the capture operator `&/1`:

      iex> add = &Kernel.+/2
      iex> add.(1, 2)
      3

      iex> length = &String.length/1
      iex> length.("hello")
      5

  It is also possible to capture a definition in the current module by
  skipping the module prefix, such as `&my_fun/2`.

  The capture operator can also be used to create anonymous functions
  that expect at least one argument:

      iex> add = &(&1 + &2)
      iex> add.(1, 2)
      3

  In such cases, using the capture operator is no different than using `fn`.

  We say that functions that point to definitions residing in modules, such
  as `&String.length/1`, are **external** functions. All other functions are
  **local** and they are always bound to the file or module that defined them.

  Besides the functions in this module to work with functions, `Kernel` also
  has an `apply/2` function that invokes a function with a dynamic number of
  arguments, as well as `is_function/1` and `is_function/2`, to check
  respectively if a given value is a function or a function of a given arity.

  @doc """
  Returns a keyword list with information about a function.

  The returned keys (with the corresponding possible values) for
  all types of functions (local and external) are the following:

    * `:type` - `:local` (for anonymous functions) or `:external` (for
      named functions).

    * `:module` - an atom which is the module where the function is defined when
    anonymous or the module which the function refers to when it's a named function.

    * `:arity` - (integer) the number of arguments the function is to be called with.

    * `:name` - (atom) the name of the function.

    * `:env` - a list of the environment or free variables. For named
      functions, the returned list is always empty.

  When `fun` is an anonymous function (that is, the type is `:local`), the following
  additional keys are returned:

    * `:pid` - PID of the process that originally created the function.

    * `:index` - (integer) an index into the module function table.

    * `:new_index` - (integer) an index into the module function table.

    * `:new_uniq` - (binary) a unique value for this function. It's
      calculated from the compiled code for the entire module.

    * `:uniq` - (integer) a unique value for this function. This integer is
      calculated from the compiled code for the entire module.

  **Note**: this function must be used only for debugging purposes.

  Returns a specific information about the function.

  The returned information is a two-element tuple in the shape of
  `{info, value}`.

  For any function, the information asked for can be any of the atoms
  `:module`, `:name`, `:arity`, `:env`, or `:type`.

  For anonymous functions, there is also information about any of the
  atoms `:index`, `:new_index`, `:new_uniq`, `:uniq`, and `:pid`.
  For a named function, the value of any of these items is always the
  atom `:undefined`.

  `info/1`.
