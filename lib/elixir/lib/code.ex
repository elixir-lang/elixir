defmodule Code do
  @moduledoc """
  Utilities for managing code compilation, code evaluation, and code loading.

  This module complements Erlang's [`:code` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/code.html)
  to add behaviour which is specific to Elixir. Almost all of the functions in this module
  have global side effects on the behaviour of Elixir.

  ## Working with files

  This module contains three functions for compiling and evaluating files.
  Here is a summary of them and their behaviour:

    * `require_file/2` - compiles a file and tracks its name. It does not
      compile the file again if it has been previously required.

    * `compile_file/2` - compiles a file without tracking its name. Compiles the
      file multiple times when invoked multiple times.

    * `eval_file/2` - evaluates the file contents without tracking its name. It
      returns the result of the last expression in the file, instead of the modules
      defined in it.

  In a nutshell, the first must be used when you want to keep track of the files
  handled by the system, to avoid the same file from being compiled multiple
  times. This is common in scripts.

  `compile_file/2` must be used when you are interested in the modules defined in a
  file, without tracking. `eval_file/2` should be used when you are intested on
  the result of evaluating the file rather than the modules it defines.

  Evaluates the contents given by `string`.

  The `binding` argument is a keyword list of variable bindings.
  The `opts` argument is a keyword list of environment options.

  **Warning**: `string` can be any Elixir code and will be executed with
  the same privileges as the Erlang VM: this means that such code could
  compromise the machine (for example by executing system commands).
  Don't use `eval_string/3` with untrusted input (such as strings coming
  from the network).

  ## Options

  Options can be:

    * `:file` - the file to be considered in the evaluation

    * `:line` - the line on which the script starts

  Additionally, the following scope values can be configured:

    * `:aliases` - a list of tuples with the alias and its target

    * `:requires` - a list of modules required

    * `:functions` - a list of tuples where the first element is a module
      and the second a list of imported function names and arity; the list
      of function names and arity must be sorted

    * `:macros` - a list of tuples where the first element is a module
      and the second a list of imported macro names and arity; the list
      of function names and arity must be sorted

  Notice that setting any of the values above overrides Elixir's default
  values. For example, setting `:requires` to `[]` will no longer
  automatically require the `Kernel` module. In the same way setting
  `:macros` will no longer auto-import `Kernel` macros like `Kernel.if/2`,
  `Kernel.SpecialForms.case/2`, and so on.

  Returns a tuple of the form `{value, binding}`,
  where `value` is the value returned from evaluating `string`.
  If an error occurs while evaluating `string` an exception will be raised.

  `binding` is a keyword list with the value of all variable bindings
  after evaluating `string`. The binding key is usually an atom, but it
  may be a tuple for variables defined in a different context.

  ## Examples

      iex> Code.eval_string("a + b", [a: 1, b: 2], file: __ENV__.file, line: __ENV__.line)
      {3, [a: 1, b: 2]}

      iex> Code.eval_string("a = a + b", [a: 1, b: 2])
      {3, [a: 3, b: 2]}

  For convenience, you can pass `__ENV__/0` as the `opts` argument and
  all imports, requires and aliases defined in the current environment
  will be automatically carried over:

      iex> Code.eval_string("a + b", [a: 1, b: 2], __ENV__)

  Formats the given code `string`.

  The formatter receives a string representing Elixir code and
  returns iodata representing the formatted code according to
  pre-defined rules.

  ## Options

    * `:file` - the file which contains the string, used for error
      reporting

    * `:line` - the line the string starts, used for error reporting

    * `:line_length` - the line length to aim for when formatting
      the document. Defaults to 98.

    * `:locals_without_parens` - a keyword list of name and arity
      pairs that should be kept without parens whenever possible.
      The arity may be the atom `:*`, which implies all arities of
      that name. The formatter already includes a list of functions
      and this option augments this list.

    * `:rename_deprecated_at` - rename all known deprecated functions
      at the given version to their non-deprecated equivalent. It
      expects a valid `Version` which is usually the minimum Elixir
      version supported by the project.

  ## Design principles

  The formatter was designed under three principles.

  First, the formatter never changes the semantics of the code by
  default. This means the input AST and the output AST are equivalent.
  Optional behaviour, such as `:rename_deprecated_at`, is allowed to
  break this guarantee.

  The second principle is to provide as little configuration as possible.
  This eases the formatter adoption by removing contention points while
  making sure a single style is followed consistently by the community as
  a whole.

  The formatter does not hard code names. The formatter will not behave
  specially because a function is named `defmodule`, `def`, etc. This
  principle mirrors Elixir's goal of being an extensible language where
  developers can extend the language with new constructs as if they were
  part of the language. When it is absolutely necessary to change behaviour
  based on the name, this behaviour should be configurable, such as the
  `:locals_without_parens` option.

  ## Keeping user's formatting

  The formatter respects the input format in some cases. Those are
  listed below:

    * Insignificant digits in numbers are kept as is. The formatter
      however always inserts underscores for decimal numbers with more
      than 5 digits and converts hexadecimal digits to uppercase

    * Strings, charlists, atoms and sigils are kept as is. No character
      is automatically escaped or unescaped. The choice of delimiter is
      also respected from the input

    * Newlines inside blocks are kept as in the input except for:
      1) expressions that take multiple lines will always have an empty
      line before and after and 2) empty lines are always squeezed
      together into a single empty line

    * The choice between `:do` keyword and `do/end` blocks is left
      to the user

    * Lists, tuples, bitstrings, maps, structs and function calls will be
      broken into multiple lines if they are followed by a newline in the
      opening bracket and preceded by a new line in the closing bracket

    * Pipeline operators, like `|>` and others with the same precedence,
      will span multiple lines if they spanned multiple lines in the input

  The behaviours above are not guaranteed. We may remove or add new
  rules in the future. The goal of documenting them is to provide better
  understanding on what to expect from the formatter.

  ## Adjusting formatted output

  The formatter attempts to the fit the most it can on a single line.
  When the code does not fit a single line, the formatter introduces
  line breaks in the code.

  In some rare situations, this may lead to undesired formatting.
  For example, the code below:

      "this is a very long string ... #{inspect(some_value)}"

  may be formatted as:

      "this is a very long string ... #{
        inspect(some_value)
      }"

  This happens because the only place the formatter can introduce a
  new line without changing the code semantics is in the interpolation.
  In those scenarios, we recommend developers to directly adjust the
  code. Here we can use the binary concatenation operator `<>/2`:

      "this is a very long string " <>
        "... #{inspect(some_value)}"

  The string concatenation makes the code fit on a single line and also
  gives more options to the formatter.

  A similar example is when the formatter breaks a function definition
  over multiple clauses:

      def my_function(
        %User{name: name, age: age, ...},
        arg1,
        arg2
      ) do

  While the code above is completely valid, you may prefer to match on
  the struct variables inside the function body in order to keep the
  definition on a single line:

      def my_function(%User{} = user, arg1, arg2) do
        %{name: name, age: age, ...} = user

  Since the formatter cannot change the semantics of your code,
  sometimes it is necessary to tweak the code to get optimal formatting.

  ### Multi-line lists, maps, tuples, etc

  You can force lists, tuples, bitstrings, maps, structs and function
  calls to have one entry per line by adding a newline after the opening
  bracket and a new line before the closing bracket lines. For example:

      [
        foo,
        bar
      ]

  If there are no newlines around the brackets, then the formatter will
  try to fit everything on a single line, such that the snippet below

      [foo,
       bar]

  will be formatted as

      [foo, bar]

  You can also force keywords to be rendered on multiple lines by
  having each entry on its own line:

      defstruct name: nil,
                age: 0

  The code above will be kept with one keyword entry per line by the
  formatter. To avoid that, just keep everything on a single line.

  ### Parens and no parens in function calls

  Elixir has two syntaxes for function calls. With parens and no parens.
  By default, Elixir will add parens to all calls except for:

    1. calls that have do/end blocks
    2. local calls without parens where the name and arity of the local
       call is also listed under `:locals_without_parens`

  The choice of parens and no parens also affects indentation. When a
  function call with parens doesn't fit on the same line, the formatter
  introduces a newline around parens and indents the arguments with two
  spaces:

      some_call(
        arg1,
        arg2,
        arg3
      )

  On the other hand, function calls without parens are always indented
  by the function call length itself, like this:

      some_call arg1,
                arg2,
                arg3

  If the last argument is a data structure, such as maps and lists, and
  the beginning of the data structure fits on the same line as the function
  call, then no indentation happens, this allows code like this:

      Enum.reduce(some_collection, initial_value, fn element, acc ->
        # code
      end)

      some_funtion_without_parens %{
        foo: :bar,
        baz: :bat
      }

  ## Code comments

  The formatter also handles code comments in a way to guarantee a space
  is always added between the beginning of the comment (#) and the next
  character.

  The formatter also extracts all trailing comments to their previous line.
  For example, the code below

      hello # world

  will be rewritten to

      # world
      hello

  Because code comments are handled apart from the code representation (AST),
  there are some situations where code comments are seen as ambiguous by the
  code formatter. For example, the comment in the anonymous function below

      fn
        arg1 ->
          body1
          # comment

        arg2 ->
          body2
      end

  and in this one

      fn
        arg1 ->
          body1

        # comment
        arg2 ->
          body2
      end

  are considered equivalent (the nesting is discarded alongside most of
  user formatting). In such cases, the code formatter will always format to
  the latter.

  Sets compilation options.

  These options are global since they are stored by Elixir's Code Server.

  Available options are:

    * `:docs` - when `true`, retain documentation in the compiled module.
      Defaults to `true`.

    * `:debug_info` - when `true`, retain debug information in the compiled
      module. This allows a developer to reconstruct the original source
      code. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:ignore_module_conflict` - when `true`, override modules that were
      already defined without raising errors. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:relative_paths` - when `true`, use relative paths in quoted nodes,
      warnings and errors generated by the compiler. Note disabling this option
      won't affect runtime warnings and errors. Defaults to `true`.

    * `:warnings_as_errors` - causes compilation to fail when warnings are
      generated. Defaults to `false`.

  It returns the new map of compiler options.

  Ensures the given module is loaded.

  If the module is already loaded, this works as no-op. If the module

  If not, returns `{:error, reason}` with the error reason.

  ## Code loading on the Erlang VM

  Erlang has two modes to load code: interactive and embedded.

  By default, the Erlang VM runs in interactive mode, where modules
  are loaded as needed. In embedded mode the opposite happens, as all
  modules need to be loaded upfront or explicitly.

  Therefore, this function is used to check if a module is loaded
  before using it and allows one to react accordingly. For example, the `URI`
  module uses this function to check if a specific parser exists for a given
  URI scheme.

  ## `ensure_compiled/1`

  Elixir also contains an `ensure_compiled/1` function that is a
  superset of `ensure_loaded/1`.

  Since Elixir's compilation happens in parallel, in some situations
  you may need to use a module that was not yet compiled, therefore
  it can't even be loaded.

  When invoked, `ensure_compiled/1` halts the compilation of the caller
  until the module given to `ensure_compiled/1` becomes available or
  all files for the current project have been compiled. If compilation
  finishes and the module is not available, an error tuple is returned.

  `ensure_compiled/1` does not apply to dependencies, as dependencies
  must be compiled upfront.

  In most cases, `ensure_loaded/1` is enough. `ensure_compiled/1`
  must be used in rare cases, usually involving macros that need to
  invoke a module for callback information.

  ## Examples

      {:module, Atom}

  Returns the docs for the given module.

  When given a module name, it finds its BEAM code and reads the docs from it.

  When given a path to a `.beam` file, it will load the docs directly from that
  file.

  The return value depends on the `kind` value:

    * `:moduledoc` - tuple `{line, doc}` where `line` is the line on
      which the module definition starts and `doc` is the string
      attached to the module using the `@moduledoc` attribute,
      `false` if `@moduledoc false` was used, or `nil` if no `@moduledoc`
      was used.

    * `:docs` - list of all docstrings attached to functions and macros
      using the `@doc` attribute. Each tuple has the form
      `{{name, arity}, line, kind, arguments, doc}`. `doc` can be either a
      string, `false` if `@doc false` was used, or `nil` if no doc was used.

    * `:callback_docs` - list of all docstrings attached to
      `@callbacks` using the `@doc` attribute. Each tuple has the form
      `{{name, arity}, line, kind, doc}`. `doc` can be either a string or
      `nil` if no `@doc` was set.

    * `:type_docs` - list of all docstrings attached to `@type` callbacks
      using the `@typedoc` attribute. Each tuple has the form
      `{{name, arity}, line, kind, doc}`. `doc` can be either a string or
      `nil` if no `@typedoc` was used.

    * `:all` - a keyword list with `:docs`, `:moduledoc`, `:callback_docs`,
      and `:type_docs`.

  If the module cannot be found, it returns `nil`.
