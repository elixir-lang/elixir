  ## Code loading on the Erlang VM

  Erlang has two modes to load code: interactive and embedded.

  By default, the Erlang VM runs on interactive mode, where modules
  are loaded as needed. In embedded mode the opposite happens, as all
  modules need to be loaded upfront or explicitly.

  Therefore, this function is useful to check if a module is loaded
  before using it and react accordingly. For example, the `URI` module
  uses this function to check if a specific parser exists for a given
  URI scheme.

  ## Code.ensure_compiled

  Elixir also contains an `ensure_compiled/1` function that is a
  superset of `ensure_loaded/1`.

  Since Elixir's compilation happens in parallel, in some situations
  you may need to use a module but it was not compiled yet, therefore
  it can't even be loaded.

  `ensure_compiled/1` puts a halt in the current process until the
  module we are depending on is available.

  In most of the cases, `ensure_loaded` is enough. `ensure_compiled`
  must be used just in same rare conditions, usually involving macros
  that needs to invoke a module for callback information.
