  This module defines the responsibilities for working with
  calendars, dates, times and datetimes in Elixir.

  Currently it defines types and the minimal implementation
  for a calendar behaviour in Elixir. The goal of the Calendar
  features in Elixir is to provide a base for interoperability
  instead of full-featured datetime API.

  For the actual date, time and datetime structures, see `Date`,
  `Time`, `NaiveDateTime` and `DateTime`.

  Note the year, month, day, etc. designations are overspecified
  (i.e. an integer instead of `1..12` for months) because different
  calendars may have a different number of days per month, months per year and so on.
