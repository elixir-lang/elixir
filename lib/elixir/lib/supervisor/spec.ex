defmodule Supervisor.Spec do
  @moduledoc """
  Outdated functions for building child specifications.

  The functions in this module are deprecated and they do not work
  with the module-based child specs introduced in Elixir v1.5.
  Please see the `Supervisor` documentation instead.

  Convenience functions for defining supervisor specifications.

  ## Example

  By using the functions in this module one can specify the children
  to be used under a supervisor, started with `Supervisor.start_link/2`:

      import Supervisor.Spec

      children = [
        worker(MyWorker, [arg1, arg2, arg3]),
        supervisor(MySupervisor, [arg1])
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  Sometimes, it may be handy to define supervisors backed
  by a module:

      defmodule MySupervisor do
        use Supervisor

        def start_link(arg) do
          Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, arg)
        end

        def init(arg) do
          children = [
            worker(MyWorker, [arg], restart: :temporary)
          ]

          supervise(children, strategy: :simple_one_for_one)
        end
      end

  Notice in this case we don't have to explicitly import
  `Supervisor.Spec` as `use Supervisor` automatically does so.
  Defining a module-based supervisor can be useful, for example,
  to perform initialization tasks in the `c:init/1` callback.

  ## Supervisor and worker options

  In the example above, we defined specs for workers and supervisors.
  These specs (both for workers as well as supervisors) accept the
  following options:

    * `:id` - a name used to identify the child specification
      internally by the supervisor; defaults to the given module
      name for the child worker/supervisor

    * `:function` - the function to invoke on the child to start it

    * `:restart` - an atom that defines when a terminated child process should
      be restarted (see the "Restart values" section below)

    * `:shutdown` - an atom that defines how a child process should be
      terminated (see the "Shutdown values" section below)

    * `:modules` - it should be a list with one element `[module]`,
      where module is the name of the callback module only if the
      child process is a `Supervisor` or `GenServer`; if the child
      process is a `GenEvent`, `:modules` should be `:dynamic`

  ### Restart values (:restart)

  The following restart values are supported in the `:restart` option:

    * `:permanent` - the child process is always restarted

    * `:temporary` - the child process is never restarted (not even
      when the supervisor's strategy is `:rest_for_one` or `:one_for_all`)

    * `:transient` - the child process is restarted only if it
      terminates abnormally, i.e., with an exit reason other than
      `:normal`, `:shutdown` or `{:shutdown, term}`

  Notice that supervisor that reached maximum restart intensity will exit with `:shutdown` reason.
  In this case the supervisor will only be restarted if its child specification was defined with
  the `:restart` option is set to `:permanent` (the default).

  ### Shutdown values (:shutdown)

  The following shutdown values are supported in the `:shutdown` option:

    * `:brutal_kill` - the child process is unconditionally terminated
      using `Process.exit(child, :kill)`

    * `:infinity` - if the child process is a supervisor, this is a mechanism
      to give the subtree enough time to shutdown; it can also be used with
      workers with care

    * any integer - the value of `:shutdown` can also be any integer meaning
      that the supervisor tells the child process to terminate by calling
      `Process.exit(child, :shutdown)` and then waits for an exit signal back.
      If no exit signal is received within the specified time (the value of this
      option, in milliseconds), the child process is unconditionally terminated
      using `Process.exit(child, :kill)`

  Receives a list of children (workers or supervisors) to
  supervise and a set of options.

  Returns a tuple containing the supervisor specification. This tuple can be
  used as the return value of the `c:init/1` callback when implementing a
  module-based supervisor.

  ## Examples

      supervise(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  ## Options

    * `:strategy` - the restart strategy option. It can be either
      `:one_for_one`, `:rest_for_one`, `:one_for_all`, or
      `:simple_one_for_one`. You can learn more about strategies
      in the `Supervisor` module docs.

    * `:max_restarts` - the maximum number of restarts allowed in
      a time frame. Defaults to `3`.

    * `:max_seconds` - the time frame in which `:max_restarts` applies.
      Defaults to `5`.

  The `:strategy` option is required and by default a maximum of 3 restarts is
  allowed within 5 seconds. Check the `Supervisor` module for a detailed
  description of the available strategies.
