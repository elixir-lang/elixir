  Conveniences for working with processes and the process dictionary.

  Besides the functions available in this module, the `Kernel` module
  exposes and auto-imports some basic functionality related to processes
  available through the following functions:

    * `Kernel.spawn/1` and `Kernel.spawn/3`
    * `Kernel.spawn_link/1` and `Kernel.spawn_link/3`
    * `Kernel.spawn_monitor/1` and `Kernel.spawn_monitor/3`
    * `Kernel.self/0`
    * `Kernel.send/2`

  While this module provides low-level conveniences to work with processes,
  developers typically use abstractions such as `Agent`, `GenServer`,
  `Registry`, `Supervisor` and `Task` for building their systems and
  resort to this module for gathering information, trapping exits, links
  and monitoring.

  Sends an exit signal with the given `reason` to `pid`.

  The following behaviour applies if `reason` is any term except `:normal`

    1. If `pid` is not trapping exits, `pid` will exit with the given

    2. If `pid` is trapping exits, the exit signal is transformed into a
       message `{:EXIT, from, reason}` and delivered to the message queue

  If `reason` is the atom `:normal`, `pid` will not exit (unless `pid` is
  the calling process, in which case it will exit with the reason `:normal`).
  If it is trapping exits, the exit signal is transformed into a message
  `{:EXIT, from, :normal}` and delivered to its message queue.

  If `reason` is the atom `:kill`, that is if `Process.exit(pid, :kill)` is called,
  an untrappable exit signal is sent to `pid` which will unconditionally exit

  Sleeps the current process for the given `timeout`.

  `timeout` is either the number of milliseconds to sleep as an
  integer or the atom `:infinity`. When `:infinity` is given,
  the current process will sleep forever, and not
  consume or reply to messages.

  **Use this function with extreme care**. For almost all situations
  where you would use `sleep/1` in Elixir, there is likely a
  more correct, faster and precise way of achieving the same with
  message passing.

  For example, if you are waiting for a process to perform some
  action, it is better to communicate the progress of such action
  with messages.

  In other words, **do not**:

      Task.start_link(fn ->
        do_something()
        ...
      end)

      # Wait until work is done
      Process.sleep(2000)

  But **do**:

      parent = self()

      Task.start_link(fn ->
        do_something()
        send(parent, :work_is_done)
        ...

        :work_is_done -> :ok
      after
        # Optional timeout
        30_000 -> :timeout
      end

  For cases like the one above, `Task.async/1` and `Task.await/2` are
  preferred.

  Similarly, if you are waiting for a process to terminate,
  monitor that process instead of sleeping. **Do not**:

      Task.start_link(fn ->
        ...
      end)

      # Wait until task terminates

    * `:nosuspend` - when used, if sending the message would cause the sender to

  Sends `msg` to `dest` after `time` milliseconds.

  If `dest` is a PID, it must be the PID of a local process, dead or alive.
  If `dest` is an atom, it must be the name of a registered process
  which is looked up at the time of delivery. No error is produced if the name does
  not refer to a process.

  The message is not sent immediately. Therefore, `dest` can receive other messages
  in-between even when `time` is `0`.

  This function returns a timer reference, which can be read with `read_timer/1`
  or canceled with `cancel_timer/1`.

  The timer will be automatically canceled if the given `dest` is a PID
  which is not alive or when the given PID exits. Note that timers will not be
  automatically canceled when `dest` is an atom (as the atom resolution is done
  on delivery).

    To read more about Erlang monotonic time and other time-related concepts,

  ## Options

    * `:async` - (boolean) when `false`, the request for cancellation is

  Puts the calling process into a "hibernation" state.

  The calling process is put into a waiting state

  which is useful if the process does not expect to receive any messages
  in the near future.
