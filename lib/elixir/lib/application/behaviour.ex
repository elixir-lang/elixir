defmodule Application.Behaviour do
  @moduledoc """
  Default callbacks for applications.

  In Erlang/OTP, an application is a component that can be started
  and stopped as a unit, and which can be reused in other systems.

  The first step in creating an application is to define an application specification.
  For example, if your application is named `:my_app`, an app specification
  should exist at `ebin/my_app.app`. This file is usually defined by
  build tools like Mix.

  With the app specification in hand, we must define
  application module callbacks that control how to start and stop
  instances of the application. This module is about defining such callbacks.

  There are two callbacks which must be implemented:

  1. `start(type, args)` - must return `{:ok, pid}` or
     `{:ok, pid, state}`, where `pid` is the process identifier
     of the supervisor tree root and `state` is application defined 
     state information;

  2. `stop(state)` - receives the `state` returned by `start` and should
     do any necessary clean up. Notice that shutting down the supervisor
     is automatically handled by the VM;

  When using this module, it tags the module behaviour as
  `:application` and provides a default `stop/1` callback. The `start/2` callback
  still needs to be implemented by the user.

  You can learn more about the `:application` module, the application
  specification and the application module callbacks from these sources:

  ## Example

      defmodule MyApp do
        use Application.Behaviour

        def start(_type, args) do
          MyApp.Sup.start_link(args)
        end
      end
