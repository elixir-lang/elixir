defmodule GenServer do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation.

  A GenServer is a process like any other Elixir process and it can be used
  to keep state, execute code asynchronously and so on. The advantage of using
  a generic server process (GenServer) implemented using this module is that it
  will have a standard set of interface functions and include functionality for
  tracing and error reporting. It will also fit into a supervision tree.

  ## Example

  The GenServer behaviour abstracts the common client-server interaction.
  Developers are only required to implement the callbacks and functionality
  they are interested in.

  Let's start with a code example and then explore the available callbacks.
  Imagine we want a GenServer that works like a stack, allowing us to push
  and pop elements:

      defmodule Stack do
        use GenServer

        # Callbacks

        @impl true
        def init(stack) do
          {:ok, stack}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_call(:pop, _from, [head | tail]) do
          {:reply, head, tail}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_cast({:push, element}, state) do
          {:noreply, [element | state]}
        end
      end

      # Start the server
      {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, [:hello])

      # This is the client
      GenServer.call(pid, :pop)
      #=> :hello

      GenServer.cast(pid, {:push, :world})
      #=> :ok

      GenServer.call(pid, :pop)
      #=> :world

  We start our `Stack` by calling `start_link/2`, passing the module
  with the server implementation and its initial argument (a list
  representing the stack containing the element `:hello`). We can primarily
  interact with the server by sending two types of messages. **call**
  messages expect a reply from the server (and are therefore synchronous)
  while **cast** messages do not.

  Every time you do a `GenServer.call/3`, the client will send a message
  that must be handled by the `c:handle_call/3` callback in the GenServer.
  A `cast/2` message must be handled by `c:handle_cast/2`. There are 8 possible
  callbacks to be implemented when you use a `GenServer`. The only required
  callback is `c:init/1`.

  ## Client / Server APIs

  Although in the example above we have used `GenServer.start_link/3` and
  friends to directly start and communicate with the server, most of the
  time we don't call the `GenServer` functions directly. Instead, we wrap
  the calls in new functions representing the public API of the server.

  Here is a better implementation of our Stack module:

      defmodule Stack do
        use GenServer

        # Client

        def start_link(default) when is_list(default) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, default)
        end

        def push(pid, element) do
          GenServer.cast(pid, {:push, element})
        end

        def pop(pid) do
          GenServer.call(pid, :pop)
        end

        # Server (callbacks)

        @impl true
        def init(stack) do
          {:ok, stack}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_call(:pop, _from, [head | tail]) do
          {:reply, head, tail}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_cast({:push, element}, state) do
          {:noreply, [element | state]}
        end
      end

  In practice, it is common to have both server and client functions in
  the same module. If the server and/or client implementations are growing
  complex, you may want to have them in different modules.

  ## How to supervise

  A `GenServer` is most commonly started under a supervision tree.
  When we invoke `use GenServer`, it automatically defines a `child_spec/1`
  function that allows us to start the `Stack` directly under a supervisor.
  To start a default stack of `[:hello]` under a supervisor, one may do:

      children = [
        {Stack, [:hello]}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_all)

  Note you can also start it simply as `Stack`, which is the same as
  `{Stack, []}`:

      children = [
        Stack # The same as {Stack, []}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_all)

  In both cases, `Stack.start_link/1` is always invoked.

  `use GenServer` also accepts a list of options which configures the
  child specification and therefore how it runs under a supervisor.
  The generated `child_spec/1` can be customized with the following options:

    * `:id` - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module
    * `:restart` - when the child should be restarted, defaults to `:permanent`
    * `:shutdown` - how to shut down the child, either immediately or by giving it time to shut down

  For example:

      use GenServer, restart: :transient, shutdown: 10_000

  See the "Child specification" section in the `Supervisor` module for more
  detailed information. The `@doc` annotation immediately preceding
  `use GenServer` will be attached to the generated `child_spec/1` function.

  ## Name registration

  Both `start_link/3` and `start/3` support the `GenServer` to register
  a name on start via the `:name` option. Registered names are also
  automatically cleaned up on termination. The supported values are:

    * an atom - the GenServer is registered locally with the given name
      using `Process.register/2`.

    * `{:global, term}` - the GenServer is registered globally with the given
      term using the functions in the [`:global` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/global.html).

    * `{:via, module, term}` - the GenServer is registered with the given
      mechanism and name. The `:via` option expects a module that exports
      `register_name/2`, `unregister_name/1`, `whereis_name/1` and `send/2`.
      One such example is the [`:global` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/global.html) which uses these functions
      for keeping the list of names of processes and their associated PIDs
      that are available globally for a network of Elixir nodes. Elixir also
      ships with a local, decentralized and scalable registry called `Registry`
      for locally storing names that are generated dynamically.

  For example, we could start and register our `Stack` server locally as follows:

      # Start the server and register it locally with name MyStack
      {:ok, _} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, [:hello], name: MyStack)

      # Now messages can be sent directly to MyStack
      GenServer.call(MyStack, :pop)
      #=> :hello

  Once the server is started, the remaining functions in this module (`call/3`,
  `cast/2`, and friends) will also accept an atom, or any `{:global, ...}` or
  `{:via, ...}` tuples. In general, the following formats are supported:

    * a PID
    * an atom if the server is locally registered
    * `{atom, node}` if the server is locally registered at another node
    * `{:global, term}` if the server is globally registered
    * `{:via, module, name}` if the server is registered through an alternative
      registry

  If there is an interest to register dynamic names locally, do not use
  atoms, as atoms are never garbage-collected and therefore dynamically
  generated atoms won't be garbage-collected. For such cases, you can
  set up your own local registry by using the `Registry` module.

  ## Receiving "regular" messages

  The goal of a `GenServer` is to abstract the "receive" loop for developers,
  automatically handling system messages, supporting code change, synchronous
  calls and more. Therefore, you should never call your own "receive" inside
  the GenServer callbacks as doing so will cause the GenServer to misbehave.

  Besides the synchronous and asynchronous communication provided by `call/3`
  and `cast/2`, "regular" messages sent by functions such as `Kernel.send/2`,
  `Process.send_after/4` and similar, can be handled inside the `c:handle_info/2`
  callback.

  `c:handle_info/2` can be used in many situations, such as handling monitor
  DOWN messages sent by `Process.monitor/1`. Another use case for `c:handle_info/2`
  is to perform periodic work, with the help of `Process.send_after/4`:

      defmodule MyApp.Periodically do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{})
        end

        @impl true
        def init(state) do
          # Schedule work to be performed on start
          schedule_work()

          {:ok, state}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_info(:work, state) do
          # Do the desired work here
          # ...

          # Reschedule once more
          schedule_work()

          {:noreply, state}
        end

        defp schedule_work do
          # We schedule the work to happen in 2 hours (written in milliseconds).
          # Alternatively, one might write :timer.hours(2)
          Process.send_after(self(), :work, 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
        end
      end

  ## Timeouts

  The return value of `c:init/1` or any of the `handle_*` callbacks may include
  a timeout value in milliseconds; if not, `:infinity` is assumed.
  The timeout can be used to detect a lull in incoming messages.

  If the process has no messages waiting when the timeout is set and the
  number of given milliseconds pass without any message arriving,
  then `handle_info/2` will be called with `:timeout` as the first argument.
  The timeout is cleared if any message is waiting or arrives before the
  given timeout.

  Because a message may arrive before the timeout is set, even a timeout of `0`
  milliseconds is not guaranteed to execute. To take another action immediately
  and unconditionally, use a `:continue` instruction.

  ## When (not) to use a GenServer

  So far, we have learned that a `GenServer` can be used as a supervised process
  that handles sync and async calls. It can also handle system messages, such as
  periodic messages and monitoring events. GenServer processes may also be named.

  A GenServer, or a process in general, must be used to model runtime characteristics
  of your system. A GenServer must never be used for code organization purposes.

  In Elixir, code organization is done by modules and functions, processes are not
  necessary. For example, imagine you are implementing a calculator and you decide
  to put all the calculator operations behind a GenServer:

      def add(a, b) do
        GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:add, a, b})
      end

      def subtract(a, b) do
        GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:subtract, a, b})
      end

      def handle_call({:add, a, b}, _from, state) do
        {:reply, a + b, state}
      end

      def handle_call({:subtract, a, b}, _from, state) do
        {:reply, a - b, state}
      end

  This is an anti-pattern not only because it convolutes the calculator logic but
  also because you put the calculator logic behind a single process that will
  potentially become a bottleneck in your system, especially as the number of
  calls grow. Instead just define the functions directly:

      def add(a, b) do
        a + b
      end

      def subtract(a, b) do
        a - b
      end

  If you don't need a process, then you don't need a process. Use processes only to
  model runtime properties, such as mutable state, concurrency and failures, never
  for code organization.

  ## Debugging with the :sys module

  GenServers, as [special processes](http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/spec_proc.html),
  can be debugged using the [`:sys` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sys.html).
  Through various hooks, this module allows developers to introspect the state of
  the process and trace system events that happen during its execution, such as
  received messages, sent replies and state changes.

  Let's explore the basic functions from the
  [`:sys` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sys.html) used for debugging:

    * `:sys.get_state/2` - allows retrieval of the state of the process.
      In the case of a GenServer process, it will be the callback module state,
      as passed into the callback functions as last argument.
    * `:sys.get_status/2` - allows retrieval of the status of the process.
      This status includes the process dictionary, if the process is running
      or is suspended, the parent PID, the debugger state, and the state of
      the behaviour module, which includes the callback module state
      (as returned by `:sys.get_state/2`). It's possible to change how this
      status is represented by defining the optional `c:GenServer.format_status/2`
      callback.
    * `:sys.trace/3` - prints all the system events to `:stdio`.
    * `:sys.statistics/3` - manages collection of process statistics.
    * `:sys.no_debug/2` - turns off all debug handlers for the given process.
      It is very important to switch off debugging once we're done. Excessive
      debug handlers or those that should be turned off, but weren't, can
      seriously damage the performance of the system.
    * `:sys.suspend/2` - allows to suspend a process so that it only
      replies to system messages but no other messages. A suspended process
      can be reactivated via `:sys.resume/2`.

  Let's see how we could use those functions for debugging the stack server
  we defined earlier.

      iex> {:ok, pid} = Stack.start_link([])
      iex> :sys.statistics(pid, true) # turn on collecting process statistics
      iex> :sys.trace(pid, true) # turn on event printing
      iex> Stack.push(pid, 1)
      *DBG* <0.122.0> got cast {push,1}
      *DBG* <0.122.0> new state [1]
      :ok

      iex> :sys.get_state(pid)
      [1]

      iex> Stack.pop(pid)
      *DBG* <0.122.0> got call pop from <0.80.0>
      *DBG* <0.122.0> sent 1 to <0.80.0>, new state []
      1

         messages_in: 2,
         messages_out: 0
       ]}

      :ok

           "$ancestors": [#PID<0.80.0>, #PID<0.51.0>]
         ],
         :running,                                        # :running | :suspended

           header: 'Status for generic server <0.122.0>', # module status
           data: [
             {'Status', :running},
             {'Parent', #PID<0.80.0>},
             {'Logged events', []}
           ],
           data: [{'State', [1]}]
         ]

  Invoked when the server is started. `start_link/3` or `start/3` will
  block until it returns.

  `init_arg` is the argument term (second argument) passed to `start_link/3`.

  Returning `{:ok, state}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:ok, pid}` and the process to enter its loop.

  Returning `{:ok, state, timeout}` is similar to `{:ok, state}`,
  except that it also sets a timeout. See the "Timeouts" section
  in the module documentation for more information.

  Returning `{:ok, state, :hibernate}` is similar to `{:ok, state}`
  except the process is hibernated before entering the loop. See
  `c:handle_call/3` for more information on hibernation.

  Returning `{:ok, state, {:continue, continue}}` is similar to
  `{:ok, state}` except that immediately after entering the loop
  the `c:handle_continue/2` callback will be invoked with the value
  `continue` as first argument.

  Returning `:ignore` will cause `start_link/3` to return `:ignore` and
  the process will exit normally without entering the loop or calling
  `c:terminate/2`. If used when part of a supervision tree the parent
  supervisor will not fail to start nor immediately try to restart the
  `GenServer`. The remainder of the supervision tree will be started
  and so the `GenServer` should not be required by other processes.
  It can be started later with `Supervisor.restart_child/2` as the child
  specification is saved in the parent supervisor. The main use cases for
  this are:

    * The `GenServer` is disabled by configuration but might be enabled later.
    * An error occurred and it will be handled by a different mechanism than the
     `Supervisor`. Likely this approach involves calling `Supervisor.restart_child/2`
      after a delay to attempt a restart.

  Returning `{:stop, reason}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:error, reason}` and the process to exit with reason `reason` without
  entering the loop or calling `c:terminate/2`.

  Invoked to handle synchronous `call/3` messages. `call/3` will block until a
  reply is received (unless the call times out or nodes are disconnected).

  `request` is the request message sent by a `call/3`, `from` is a 2-tuple
  containing the caller's PID and a term that uniquely identifies the call, and
  `state` is the current state of the `GenServer`.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state}` sends the response `reply` to the
  caller and continues the loop with new state `new_state`.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state, timeout}` is similar to
  `{:reply, reply, new_state}` except that it also sets a timeout.
  See the "Timeouts" section in the module documentation for more information.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state, :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:reply, reply, new_state}` except the process is hibernated and will
  continue the loop once a message is in its message queue. If a message is
  already in the message queue this will be immediately. Hibernating a
  `GenServer` causes garbage collection and leaves a continuous heap that
  minimises the memory used by the process.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state, {:continue, continue}}` is similar to
  `{:reply, reply, new_state}` except `c:handle_continue/2` will be invoked
  immediately after with the value `continue` as first argument.

  Hibernating should not be used aggressively as too much time could be spent
  garbage collecting. Normally it should only be used when a message is not
  expected soon and minimising the memory of the process is shown to be
  beneficial.

  Returning `{:noreply, new_state}` does not send a response to the caller and
  continues the loop with new state `new_state`. The response must be sent with
  `reply/2`.

  There are three main use cases for not replying using the return value:

    * To reply before returning from the callback because the response is known
      before calling a slow function.
    * To reply after returning from the callback because the response is not yet
      available.
    * To reply from another process, such as a task.

  When replying from another process the `GenServer` should exit if the other
  process exits without replying as the caller will be blocking awaiting a
  reply.

  Returning `{:noreply, new_state, timeout | :hibernate | {:continue, continue}}`
  is similar to `{:noreply, new_state}` except a timeout, hibernation or continue
  occurs as with a `:reply` tuple.

  Returning `{:stop, reason, reply, new_state}` stops the loop and `c:terminate/2`
  is called with reason `reason` and state `new_state`. Then the `reply` is sent
  as the response to call and the process exits with reason `reason`.

  Returning `{:stop, reason, new_state}` is similar to

  Invoked when the server is about to exit. It should do any cleanup required.

  `reason` is exit reason and `state` is the current state of the `GenServer`.
  The return value is ignored.

  `c:terminate/2` is called if a callback (except `c:init/1`) does one of the
  following:

    * returns a `:stop` tuple
    * raises
    * calls `Kernel.exit/1`
    * returns an invalid value
    * the `GenServer` traps exits (using `Process.flag/2`) *and* the parent
      process sends an exit signal

  If part of a supervision tree, a `GenServer` will receive an exit
  signal when the tree is shutting down. The exit signal is based on
  the shutdown strategy in the child's specification, where this
  value can be:

    * `:brutal_kill`: the `GenServer` is killed and so `c:terminate/2` is not called.

    * a timeout value, where the supervisor will send the exit signal `:shutdown` and
      the `GenServer` will have the duration of the timeout to terminate.
      If after duration of this timeout the process is still alive, it will be killed
      immediately.

  For a more in-depth explanation, please read the "Shutdown values (:shutdown)"
  section in the `Supervisor` module.

  If the `GenServer` receives an exit signal (that is not `:normal`) from any
  process when it is not trapping exits it will exit abruptly with the same
  reason and so not call `c:terminate/2`. Note that a process does *NOT* trap
  exits by default and an exit signal is sent when a linked process exits or its
  node is disconnected.

  Therefore it is not guaranteed that `c:terminate/2` is called when a `GenServer`
  exits. For such reasons, we usually recommend important clean-up rules to
  happen in separated processes either by use of monitoring or by links
  themselves. There is no cleanup needed when the `GenServer` controls a `port` (for example,
  `:gen_tcp.socket`) or `t:File.io_device/0`, because these will be closed on
  receiving a `GenServer`'s exit signal and do not need to be closed manually
  in `c:terminate/2`.

  If `reason` is neither `:normal`, `:shutdown`, nor `{:shutdown, term}` an error is
  logged.

  This callback is optional.

  Returning `{:error, reason}` fails the code change with reason `reason` and

  Starts a `GenServer` process linked to the current process.

  This is often used to start the `GenServer` as part of a supervision tree.

  Once the server is started, the `c:init/1` function of the given `module` is
  called with `init_arg` as its argument to initialize the server. To ensure a
  synchronized start-up procedure, this function does not return until `c:init/1`
  has returned.

  Note that a `GenServer` started with `start_link/3` is linked to the
  parent process and will exit in case of crashes from the parent. The GenServer
  will also exit due to the `:normal` reasons in case it is configured to trap
  exits in the `c:init/1` callback.

  ## Options

    * `:name` - used for name registration as described in the "Name
      registration" section in the documentation for `GenServer`

    * `:timeout` - if present, the server is allowed to spend the given number of
      milliseconds initializing or it will be terminated and the start function
      will return `{:error, :timeout}`

    * `:debug` - if present, the corresponding function in the [`:sys` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sys.html) is invoked

    * `:spawn_opt` - if present, its value is passed as options to the
      underlying process as in `Process.spawn/4`

    * `:hibernate_after` - if present, the GenServer process awaits any message for
      the given number of milliseconds and if no message is received, the process goes
      into hibernation automatically (by calling `:proc_lib.hibernate/3`).

  ## Return values

  If the server is successfully created and initialized, this function returns
  `{:ok, pid}`, where `pid` is the PID of the server. If a process with the
  specified server name already exists, this function returns
  `{:error, {:already_started, pid}}` with the PID of that process.

  If the `c:init/1` callback fails with `reason`, this function returns
  `{:error, reason}`. Otherwise, if it returns `{:stop, reason}`
  or `:ignore`, the process is terminated and this function returns
  `{:error, reason}` or `:ignore`, respectively.
