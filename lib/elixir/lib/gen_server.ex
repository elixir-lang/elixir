defmodule GenServer do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation.

  A GenServer is a process like any other Elixir process and it can be used
  to keep state, execute code asynchronously and so on. The advantage of using
  a generic server process (GenServer) implemented using this module is that it
  will have a standard set of interface functions and include functionality for
  tracing and error reporting. It will also fit into a supervision tree.

  ## Example

  The GenServer behaviour abstracts the common client-server interaction.
  Developers are only required to implement the callbacks and functionality they are
  interested in.

  Let's start with a code example and then explore the available callbacks.
  Imagine we want a GenServer that works like a stack, allowing us to push
  and pop items:

      defmodule Stack do
        use GenServer

        # Callbacks

        def handle_call(:pop, _from, [h | t]) do
          {:reply, h, t}
        end

        def handle_cast({:push, item}, state) do
          {:noreply, [item | state]}
        end
      end

      # Start the server
      {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, [:hello])

      # This is the client
      GenServer.call(pid, :pop)
      #=> :hello

      GenServer.cast(pid, {:push, :world})
      #=> :ok

      GenServer.call(pid, :pop)
      #=> :world

  We start our `Stack` by calling `start_link/3`, passing the module
  with the server implementation and its initial argument (a list
  representing the stack containing the item `:hello`). We can primarily
  interact with the server by sending two types of messages. **call**
  messages expect a reply from the server (and are therefore synchronous)
  while **cast** messages do not.

  Every time you do a `GenServer.call/3`, the client will send a message
  that must be handled by the `handle_call/3` callback in the GenServer.
  A `cast/2` message must be handled by `handle_cast/2`.

  ## Callbacks

  There are 6 callbacks required to be implemented in a `GenServer`. By
  adding `use GenServer` to your module, Elixir will automatically define
  all 6 callbacks for you, leaving it up to you to implement the ones
  you want to customize.

  ## Name Registration

  Both `start_link/3` and `start/3` support the `GenServer` to register
  a name on start via the `:name` option. Registered names are also
  automatically cleaned up on termination. The supported values are:

    * an atom - the GenServer is registered locally with the given name
      using `Process.register/2`.

    * `{:global, term}`- the GenServer is registered globally with the given
      term using the functions in the `:global` module.

    * `{:via, module, term}` - the GenServer is registered with the given
      mechanism and name. The `:via` option expects a module that exports
      `register_name/2`, `unregister_name/1`, `whereis_name/1` and `send/2`.
      One such example is the `:global` module which uses these functions
      for keeping the list of names of processes and their  associated pid's
      that are available globally for a network of Erlang nodes.

  For example, we could start and register our Stack server locally as follows:

      # Start the server and register it locally with name MyStack
      {:ok, _} = GenServer.start_link(Stack, [:hello], name: MyStack)

      # Now messages can be sent directly to MyStack
      GenServer.call(MyStack, :pop) #=> :hello

  Once the server is started, the remaining functions in this module (`call/3`,
  `cast/2`, and friends) will also accept an atom, or any `:global` or `:via`
  tuples. In general, the following formats are supported:

    * a `pid`
    * an `atom` if the server is locally registered
    * `{atom, node}` if the server is locally registered at another node
    * `{:global, term}` if the server is globally registered
    * `{:via, module, name}` if the server is registered through an alternative
      registry

  ## Client / Server APIs

  Although in the example above we have used `GenServer.start_link/3` and
  friends to directly start and communicate with the server, most of the
  time we don't call the `GenServer` functions directly. Instead, we wrap
  the calls in new functions representing the public API of the server.

  Here is a better implementation of our Stack module:

      defmodule Stack do
        use GenServer

        # Client

        def start_link(default) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, default)
        end

        def push(pid, item) do
          GenServer.cast(pid, {:push, item})
        end

        def pop(pid) do
          GenServer.call(pid, :pop)
        end

        # Server (callbacks)

        def handle_call(:pop, _from, [h | t]) do
          {:reply, h, t}
        end

        def handle_call(request, from, state) do
          # Call the default implementation from GenServer
          super(request, from, state)
        end

        def handle_cast({:push, item}, state) do
          {:noreply, [item | state]}
        end

        def handle_cast(request, state) do
          super(request, state)
        end
      end

  In practice, it is common to have both server and client functions in
  the same module. If the server and/or client implementations are growing
  complex, you may want to have them in different modules.

  ## Receiving custom messages

  The goal of a `GenServer` is to abstract the "receive" loop for developers,
  automatically handling system messages, support code change, synchronous
  calls and more. Therefore, you should never call your own "receive" inside
  the GenServer callbacks as doing so will cause the GenServer to misbehave.
  If you want to receive custom messages, always receive them in `handle_info/2`.

  Invoked when the server is started. `start_link/3` (or `start/3`) will
  block until it returns.

  `args` is the argument term (second argument) passed to `start_link/3`.

  Returning `{:ok, state}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:ok, pid}` and the process to enter its loop.

  Returning `{:ok, state, timeout}` is similar to `{:ok, state}`
  except `handle_info(:timeout, state)` will be called after `timeout`
  milliseconds if no messages are received within the timeout.

  Returning `{:ok, state, :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:ok, state}` except the process is hibernated before entering the loop. See
  `handle_call/3` for more information on hibernation.

  Returning `:ignore` will cause `start_link/3` to return `:ignore` and the
  process will exit normally without entering the loop or calling `terminate/2`.
  If used when part of a supervision tree the parent supervisor will not fail
  to start nor immediately try to restart the `GenServer`. The remainder of the
  supervision tree will be (re)started and so the `GenServer` should not be
  required by other processes. It can be started later with
  `Supervisor.restart_child/2` as the child specification is saved in the parent
  supervisor. The main use cases for this are:

    * The `GenServer` is disabled by configuration but might be enabled later.
    * An error occurred and it will be handled by a different mechanism than the
     `Supervisor`. Likely this approach involves calling `Supervisor.restart_child/2`
      after a delay to attempt a restart.

  Returning `{:stop, reason}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:error, reason}` and the process to exit with reason `reason` without
  entering the loop or calling `terminate/2`.

  Invoked to handle synchronous `call/3` messages. `call/3` will block until a
  reply is received (unless the call times out or nodes are disconnected).

  `request` is the request message sent by a `call/3`, `from` is a 2-tuple
  containing the caller's pid and a term that uniquely identifies the call, and
  `state` is the current state of the `GenServer`.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state}` sends the response `reply` to the
  caller and continues the loop with new state `new_state`.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state, timeout}` is similar to
  `{:reply, reply, new_state}` except `handle_info(:timeout, new_state)` will be
  called after `timeout` milliseconds if no messages are received.

  Returning `{:reply, reply, new_state, :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:reply, reply, new_state}` except the process is hibernated and will
  continue the loop once a message is in its message queue. If a message is
  already in the message queue this will be immediately. Hibernating a
  `GenServer` causes garbage collection and leaves a continuous heap that
  minimises the memory used by the process.

  Hibernating should not be used aggressively as too much time could be spent
  garbage collecting. Normally it should only be used when a message is not
  expected soon and minimising the memory of the process is shown to be
  beneficial.

  Returning `{:noreply, new_state}` does not send a response to the caller and
  continues the loop with new state `new_state`. The response must be sent with
  `reply/2`.

  There are three main use cases for not replying using the return value:

    * To reply before returning from the callback because the response is known
      before calling a slow function.
    * To reply after returning from the callback because the response is not yet
      available.
    * To reply from another process, such as a task.

  When replying from another process the `GenServer` should exit if the other
  process exits without replying as the caller will be blocking awaiting a
  reply.

  Returning `{:noreply, new_state, timeout | :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:noreply, new_state}` except a timeout or hibernation occurs as with a
  `:reply` tuple.

  Returning `{:stop, reason, reply, new_state}` stops the loop and `terminate/2`
  is called with reason `reason` and state `new_state`. Then the `reply` is sent
  as the response to call and the process exits with reason `reason`.

  Returning `{:stop, reason, new_state}` is similar to
  `{:stop, reason, reply, new_state}` except a reply is not sent.

  If this callback is not implemented, the default implementation by
  `use GenServer` will return `{:stop, {:bad_call, request}, state}`.

  Invoked when the server is about to exit. It should do any cleanup required.

  `reason` is exit reason and `state` is the current state of the `GenServer`.
  The return value is ignored.

  `terminate/2` is called if a callback (except `init/1`) returns a `:stop`
  tuple, raises, calls `Kernel.exit/1` or returns an invalid value. It may also
  be called if the `GenServer` traps exits using `Process.flag/2` *and* the
  parent process sends an exit signal.

  If part of a supervision tree a `GenServer`'s `Supervisor` will send an exit
  signal when shutting it down. The exit signal is based on the shutdown
  strategy in the child's specification. If it is `:brutal_kill` the `GenServer`
  is killed and so `terminate/2` is not called. However if it is a timeout the
  `Supervisor` will send the exit signal `:shutdown` and the `GenServer` will
  have the duration of the timeout to call `terminate/2` - if the process is
  still alive after the timeout it is killed.

  If the `GenServer` receives an exit signal (that is not `:normal`) from any
  process when it is not trapping exits it will exit abruptly with the same
  reason and so not call `terminate/2`. Note that a process does *NOT* trap
  exits by default and an exit signal is sent when a linked process exits or its
  node is disconnected.

  Therefore it is not guaranteed that `terminate/2` is called when a `GenServer`
  exits. For such reasons, we usually recommend important clean-up rules to
  happen in separated processes either by use of monitoring or by links
  themselves. For example if the `GenServer` controls a `port` (e.g.
  `:gen_tcp.socket`) or `File.io_device`, they will be closed on receiving a
  `GenServer`'s exit signal and do not need to be closed in `terminate/2`.

  Starts a `GenServer` process linked to the current process.

  This is often used to start the `GenServer` as part of a supervision tree.

  Once the server is started, the `init/1` function of the given `module` is
  called with `args` as its arguments to initialize the server. To ensure a
  synchronized start-up procedure, this function does not return until `init/1`
  has returned.

  Note that a `GenServer` started with `start_link/3` is linked to the
  parent process and will exit in case of crashes from the parent. The GenServer
  will also exit due to the `:normal` reasons in case it is configured to trap
  exits in the `init/1` callback.

  ## Options

    * `:name` - used for name registration as described in the "Name
      registration" section of the module documentation

    * `:timeout` - if present, the server is allowed to spend the given amount of
      milliseconds initializing or it will be terminated and the start function
      will return `{:error, :timeout}`

    * `:debug` - if present, the corresponding function in the [`:sys`
      module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sys.html) is invoked

    * `:spawn_opt` - if present, its value is passed as options to the
      underlying process as in `Process.spawn/4`

  `{:error, {:already_started, pid}}` with the pid of that process.

  If the `init/1` callback fails with `reason`, this function returns
  `{:error, reason}`. Otherwise, if it returns `{:stop, reason}`
  or `:ignore`, the process is terminated and this function returns
  `{:error, reason}` or `:ignore`, respectively.

  Calls all servers locally registered as `name` at the specified `nodes`.

  First, the `request` is sent to every node in `nodes`; then, the caller waits
  for the replies. This function returns a two-element tuple `{replies,
  bad_nodes}` where:

    * `replies` - is a list of `{node, reply}` tuples where `node` is the node
      that replied and `reply` is its reply
    * `bad_nodes` - is a list of nodes that either did not exist or where a
      server with the given `name` did not exist or did not reply

  `nodes` is a list of node names to which the request is sent. The default
  value is the list of all known nodes (including this node).

  To avoid that late answers (after the timeout) pollute the caller's message
  queue, a middleman process is used to do the actual calls. Late answers will
  then be discarded when they arrive to a terminated process.

  ## Examples

  Assuming the `Stack` GenServer mentioned in the docs for the `GenServer`
  module is registered as `Stack` in the `:"foo@my-machine"` and
  `:"bar@my-machine"` nodes:

      GenServer.multi_call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> {[{:"foo@my-machine", :hello}, {:"bar@my-machine", :world}], []}

  Replies to a client.

  This function can be used to explicitely send a reply to a client that called
  `call/3` or `multi_call/4` when the reply cannot be specified in the return
  value of `handle_call/3`.

  `client` must be the `from` argument (the second argument) accepted by
  `handle_call/3` callbacks. `reply` is an arbitrary term which will be given
  back to the client as the return value of the call.

  Note that `reply/2` can be called from any process, not just the GenServer
  that originally received the call (as long as that GenServer communicated the
  `from` argument somehow).

  This function always returns `:ok`.

  ## Examples

      def handle_call(:reply_in_one_second, from, state) do
        Process.send_after(self(), {:reply, from}, 1_000)
        {:noreply, state}
