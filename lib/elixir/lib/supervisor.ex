defmodule Supervisor do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  A behaviour module for implementing supervisors.

  A supervisor is a process which supervises other processes, which we
  refer to as *child processes*. Supervisors are used to build a hierarchical
  process structure called a *supervision tree*. Supervision trees provide
  fault-tolerance and encapsulate how our applications start and shutdown.

  A supervisor may be started directly with a list of children via
  `start_link/2` or you may define a module-based supervisor that implements
  the required callbacks. The sections below use `start_link/2` to start
  supervisors in most examples, but it also includes a specific section
  on module-based ones.

  ## Examples

  In order to start a supervisor, we need to first define a child process
  that will be supervised. As an example, we will define a GenServer that
  represents a stack:

      defmodule Stack do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(state) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, state, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        ## Callbacks

        @impl true
        def init(stack) do
          {:ok, stack}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_call(:pop, _from, [head | tail]) do
          {:reply, head, tail}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_cast({:push, head}, tail) do
          {:noreply, [head | tail]}
        end
      end

  The stack is a small wrapper around lists. It allows us to put
  an element on the top of the stack, by prepending to the list,
  and to get the top of the stack by pattern matching.

  We can now start a supervisor that will start and supervise our
  stack process. The first step is to define a list of **child
  specifications** that control how each child behaves. Each child
  specification is a map, as shown below:

      children = [
        # The Stack is a child started via Stack.start_link([:hello])
        %{
          id: Stack,
          start: {Stack, :start_link, [[:hello]]}
        }
      ]

      # Now we start the supervisor with the children and a strategy
      {:ok, pid} = Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

      # After started, we can query the supervisor for information
      Supervisor.count_children(pid)
      #=> %{active: 1, specs: 1, supervisors: 0, workers: 1}

  Notice that when starting the GenServer, we are registering it
  with name `Stack`, which allows us to call it directly and get
  what is on the stack:

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> :hello

      GenServer.cast(Stack, {:push, :world})
      #=> :ok

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> :world

  However, there is a bug in our stack server. If we call `:pop` and
  the stack is empty, it is going to crash because no clause matches:

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      ** (exit) exited in: GenServer.call(Stack, :pop, 5000)

  Luckily, since the server is being supervised by a supervisor, the
  supervisor will automatically start a new one, with the initial stack
  of `[:hello]`:

      GenServer.call(Stack, :pop)
      #=> :hello

  Supervisors support different strategies; in the example above, we
  have chosen `:one_for_one`. Furthermore, each supervisor can have many
  workers and/or supervisors as children, with each one having its own
  configuration (as outlined in the "Child specification" section).

  The rest of this document will cover how child processes are specified,
  how they can be started and stopped, different supervision strategies
  and more.

  ## Child specification

  The child specification describes how the supervisor starts, shuts down,
  and restarts child processes.

  The child specification is a map which contains 6 elements. The first two keys
  in the following list are required, and the remaining ones are optional:

    * `:id` - any term used to identify the child specification
      internally by the supervisor; defaults to the given module.
      In the case of conflicting `:id` values, the supervisor will refuse
      to initialize and require explicit IDs. This key is required.

    * `:start` - a tuple with the module-function-args to be invoked
      to start the child process. This key is required.

    * `:restart` - an atom that defines when a terminated child process
       should be restarted (see the "Restart values" section below).
       This key is optional and defaults to `:permanent`.

    * `:shutdown` - an integer or atom that defines how a child process should
      be terminated (see the "Shutdown values" section below). This key
      is optional and defaults to `5_000` if the type is `:worker` or
      `:infinity` if the type is `:supervisor`.

    * `:type` - specifies that the child process is a `:worker` or a
      `:supervisor`. This key is optional and defaults to `:worker`.

  There is a sixth key, `:modules`, which is optional and is rarely changed.
  It is set automatically based on the `:start` value.

  Let's understand what the `:shutdown` and `:restart` options control.

  ### Shutdown values (:shutdown)

  The following shutdown values are supported in the `:shutdown` option:

    * `:brutal_kill` - the child process is unconditionally and immediately
      terminated using `Process.exit(child, :kill)`.

    * any integer >= 0 - the amount of time in milliseconds that the
      supervisor will wait for its children to terminate after emitting a
      `Process.exit(child, :shutdown)` signal. If the child process is
      not trapping exits, the initial `:shutdown` signal will terminate
      the child process immediately. If the child process is trapping
      exits, it has the given amount of time to terminate.
      If it doesn't terminate within the specified time, the child process
      is unconditionally terminated by the supervisor via
      `Process.exit(child, :kill)`.

    * `:infinity` - works as an integer except the supervisor will wait
      indefinitely for the child to terminate. If the child process is a
      supervisor, the recommended value is `:infinity` to give the supervisor
      and its children enough time to shut down. This option can be used with
      regular workers but doing so is discouraged and requires extreme care.
      If not used carefully, the child process will never terminate,
      preventing your application from terminating as well.

  ### Restart values (:restart)

  The `:restart` option controls what the supervisor should consider to
  be a successful termination or not. If the termination is successful,
  the supervisor won't restart the child. If the child process crashed,
  the supervisor will start a new one.

  The following restart values are supported in the `:restart` option:

    * `:permanent` - the child process is always restarted.

    * `:temporary` - the child process is never restarted, regardless
      of the supervision strategy: any termination (even abnormal) is
      considered successful.

    * `:transient` - the child process is restarted only if it
      terminates abnormally, i.e., with an exit reason other than
      `:normal`, `:shutdown`, or `{:shutdown, term}`.

  For a more complete understanding of the exit reasons and their
  impact, see the "Exit reasons and restarts" section.

  ## child_spec/1

  When starting a supervisor, we pass a list of child specifications. Those
  specifications are maps that tell how the supervisor should start, stop and
  restart each of its children:

      %{
        id: Stack,
        start: {Stack, :start_link, [[:hello]]}
      }

  The map above defines a child with `:id` of `Stack` that is started
  by calling `Stack.start_link([:hello])`.

  However, specifying the child specification for each child as a map can be
  quite error prone, as we may change the Stack implementation and forget to
  update its specification. That's why Elixir allows you to pass a tuple with
  the module name and the `start_link` argument instead of the specification:

      children = [
        {Stack, [:hello]}
      ]

  The supervisor will then invoke `Stack.child_spec([:hello])` to retrieve a
  child specification. Now the `Stack` module is responsible for building its
  own specification, for example, we could write:

      def child_spec(arg) do
        %{
          id: Stack,
          start: {Stack, :start_link, [arg]}
        }
      end

  Luckily for us, `use GenServer` already defines a `Stack.child_spec/1`
  exactly like above. If you need to customize the `GenServer`, you can
  pass the options directly to `use GenServer`:

      use GenServer, restart: :transient

  Finally, note it is also possible to simply pass the `Stack` module as
  a child:

      children = [
        Stack
      ]

  When only the module name is given, it is equivalent to `{Stack, []}`.
  By replacing the map specification by `{Stack, [:hello]}` or `Stack`, we keep
  the child specification encapsulated in the `Stack` module, using the default
  implementation defined by `use GenServer`. We can now share our `Stack` worker
  with other developers and they can add it directly to their supervision tree
  without worrying about the low-level details of the worker.

  Overall, the child specification can be one of the following:

    * a map representing the child specification itself - as outlined in the
      "Child specification" section
    * a tuple with a module as first element and the start argument as second -
      such as `{Stack, [:hello]}`. In this case, `Stack.child_spec([:hello])`
      is called to retrieve the child specification
    * a module - such as `Stack`. In this case, `Stack.child_spec([])`
      is called to retrieve the child specification

  If you need to convert a tuple or a module child specification to a map or
  modify a child specification, you can use the `Supervisor.child_spec/2` function.
  For example, to run the stack with a different `:id` and a `:shutdown` value of
  10 seconds (10_000 milliseconds):

      children = [
        Supervisor.child_spec({Stack, [:hello]}, id: MyStack, shutdown: 10_000)
      ]

  ## Module-based supervisors

  In the example above, a supervisor was started by passing the supervision
  structure to `start_link/2`. However, supervisors can also be created by
  explicitly defining a supervision module:

      defmodule MyApp.Supervisor do
        # Automatically defines child_spec/1
        use Supervisor

        def start_link(init_arg) do
          Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, init_arg, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        @impl true
        def init(_init_arg) do
          children = [
            {Stack, [:hello]}
          ]

          Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
        end
      end

  The difference between the two approaches is that a module-based
  supervisor gives you more direct control over how the supervisor
  is initialized. Instead of calling `Supervisor.start_link/2` with
  a list of children that are automatically initialized, we manually
  initialized the children by calling `Supervisor.init/2` inside its
  `c:init/1` callback.

  `use Supervisor` also defines a `child_spec/1` function which allows
  us to run `MyApp.Supervisor` as a child of another supervisor or
  at the top of your supervision tree as:

      children = [
        MyApp.Supervisor
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  A general guideline is to use the supervisor without a callback
  module only at the top of your supervision tree, generally in the
  `c:Application.start/2` callback. We recommend using module-based
  supervisors for any other supervisor in your application, so they
  can run as a child of another supervisor in the tree. The `child_spec/1`
  generated automatically by `Supervisor` can be customized with the
  following options:

    * `:id` - the child specification identifier, defaults to the current module
    * `:restart` - when the supervisor should be restarted, defaults to `:permanent`

  The `@doc` annotation immediately preceding `use Supervisor` will be
  attached to the generated `child_spec/1` function.

  ## `start_link/2`, `init/2`, and strategies

  So far we have started the supervisor passing a single child as a tuple
  as well as a strategy called `:one_for_one`:

      children = [
        {Stack, [:hello]}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  or from inside the `c:init/1` callback:

      children = [
        {Stack, [:hello]}
      ]

      Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  The first argument given to `start_link/2` and `init/2` is a list of child
  specifications as defined in the "child_spec/1" section above.

  The second argument is a keyword list of options:

    * `:strategy` - the supervision strategy option. It can be either
      `:one_for_one`, `:rest_for_one` or `:one_for_all`. Required.
      See the "Strategies" section.

    * `:max_restarts` - the maximum number of restarts allowed in
      a time frame. Defaults to `3`.

    * `:max_seconds` - the time frame in which `:max_restarts` applies.
      Defaults to `5`.

    * `:name` - a name to register the supervisor process. Supported values are
      explained in the "Name registration" section in the documentation for
      `GenServer`. Optional.

  ### Strategies

  Supervisors support different supervision strategies (through the
  `:strategy` option, as seen above):

    * `:one_for_one` - if a child process terminates, only that
      process is restarted.

    * `:one_for_all` - if a child process terminates, all other child
      processes are terminated and then all child processes (including
      the terminated one) are restarted.

    * `:rest_for_one` - if a child process terminates, the terminated child
      process and the rest of the children started after it, are terminated and
      restarted.

  In the above, process termination refers to unsuccessful termination, which
  is determined by the `:restart` option.

  To dynamically supervise children, see `DynamicSupervisor`.

  ### Name registration

  A supervisor is bound to the same name registration rules as a `GenServer`.
  Read more about these rules in the documentation for `GenServer`.

  ## Start and shutdown

  When the supervisor starts, it traverses all child specifications and
  then starts each child in the order they are defined. This is done by
  calling the function defined under the `:start` key in the child
  specification and typically defaults to `start_link/1`.

  The `start_link/1` (or a custom) is then called for each child process.
  The `start_link/1` function must return `{:ok, pid}` where `pid` is the
  process identifier of a new process that is linked to the supervisor.
  The child process usually starts its work by executing the `c:init/1`
  callback. Generally speaking, the `init` callback is where we initialize
  and configure the child process.

  The shutdown process happens in reverse order.

  When a supervisor shuts down, it terminates all children in the opposite
  order they are listed. The termination happens by sending a shutdown exit
  signal, via `Process.exit(child_pid, :shutdown)`, to the child process and
  then awaiting for a time interval for the child process to terminate. This
  interval defaults to 5000 milliseconds. If the child process does not
  terminate in this interval, the supervisor abruptly terminates the child
  with reason `:kill`. The shutdown time can be configured in the child
  specification which is fully detailed in the next section.

  If the child process is not trapping exits, it will shutdown immediately
  when it receives the first exit signal. If the child process is trapping
  exits, then the `terminate` callback is invoked, and the child process
  must terminate in a reasonable time interval before being abruptly
  terminated by the supervisor.

  In other words, if it is important that a process cleans after itself
  when your application or the supervision tree is shutting down, then
  this process must trap exits and its child specification should specify
  the proper `:shutdown` value, ensuring it terminates within a reasonable
  interval.

  ## Exit reasons and restarts

  A supervisor restarts a child process depending on its `:restart` configuration.
  For example, when `:restart` is set to `:transient`, the supervisor does not
  restart the child in case it exits with reason `:normal`, `:shutdown` or
  `{:shutdown, term}`.

  So one may ask: which exit reason should I choose when exiting? There are
  three options:

    * `:normal` - in such cases, the exit won't be logged, there is no restart
      in transient mode, and linked processes do not exit

    * `:shutdown` or `{:shutdown, term}` - in such cases, the exit won't be
      logged, there is no restart in transient mode, and linked processes exit
      with the same reason unless they're trapping exits

    * any other term - in such cases, the exit will be logged, there are
      restarts in transient mode, and linked processes exit with the same
      reason unless they're trapping exits

  Notice that the supervisor that reaches maximum restart intensity will exit with
  `:shutdown` reason. In this case the supervisor will only be restarted if its
  child specification was defined with the `:restart` option set to `:permanent`
  (the default).

      However, if you don't own the given module and it doesn't implement
      child_spec/1, instead of passing the module name directly as a supervisor
      child, you will have to pass a child specification as a map:

          %{
            id: #{inspect(module)},
            start: {#{inspect(module)}, :start_link, [arg1, arg2]}

  Builds and overrides a child specification.

  Similar to `start_link/2` and `init/2`, it expects a
  `module`, `{module, arg}` or a map as the child specification.
  If a module is given, the specification is retrieved by calling
  `module.child_spec(arg)`.

  After the child specification is retrieved, the fields on `overrides`
  are directly applied on the child spec. If `overrides` has keys that
  do not map to any child specification field, an error is raised.

  See the "Child specification" section in the module documentation
  for all of the available keys for overriding.

  ## Examples

  This function is often used to set an `:id` option when
  the same module needs to be started multiple times in the
  supervision tree:

      Supervisor.child_spec({Agent, fn -> :ok end}, id: {Agent, 1})
      #=> %{id: {Agent, 1},
      #=>   start: {Agent, :start_link, [fn -> :ok end]}}

  Starts a module-based supervisor process with the given `module` and `init_arg`.

  To start the supervisor, the `c:init/1` callback will be invoked in the given

  `:ignore` as well and the supervisor terminates with reason `:normal`.

  error, and the supervisor terminates with reason `term`.

  The `:name` option can also be given in order to register a supervisor
  name, the supported values are described in the "Name registration"
