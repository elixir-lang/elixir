defmodule Application do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for working with applications and defining application callbacks.

  In Elixir (actually, in Erlang/OTP), an application is a component
  implementing some specific functionality, that can be started and stopped
  as a unit, and which can be re-used in other systems.

  Applications are defined with an application file named `APP.app` where
  `APP` is the application name, usually in `underscore_case`. The application
  file must reside in the same `ebin` directory as the compiled modules of the
  application.

  In Elixir, Mix is responsible for compiling your source code and
  generating your application `.app` file. Furthermore, Mix is also
  responsible for configuring, starting and stopping your application
  and its dependencies. For this reason, this documentation will focus
  on the remaining aspects of your application: the application environment
  and the application callback module.

  You can learn more about Mix generation of `.app` files by typing
  `mix help compile.app`.

  ## Application environment

  Once an application is started, OTP provides an application environment
  that can be used to configure the application.

  Assuming you are inside a Mix project, you can edit the `application`
  function in the `mix.exs` file to the following:

      def application do
        [env: [hello: :world]]
      end

  In the application function, we can define the default environment values
  for our application. By starting your application with `iex -S mix`, you
  can access the default value:

      Application.get_env(:APP_NAME, :hello)
      #=> :world

  It is also possible to put and delete values from the application value,
  including new values that are not defined in the environment file (although
  this should be avoided).

  Keep in mind that each application is responsible for its environment.
  Do not use the functions in this module for directly accessing or modifying
  the environment of other applications (as it may lead to inconsistent
  data in the application environment).

  ## Application module callback

  Often times, an application defines a supervision tree that must be started
  and stopped when the application starts and stops. For such, we need to
  define an application module callback. The first step is to define the
  module callback in the application definition in the `mix.exs` file:

      def application do
        [mod: {MyApp, []}]
      end

  Our application now requires the `MyApp` module to provide an application
  callback. This can be done by invoking `use Application` in that module and
  defining a `start/2` callback, for example:

      defmodule MyApp do
        use Application

        def start(_type, _args) do
          MyApp.Supervisor.start_link()
        end
      end

  `start/2` typically returns `{:ok, pid}` or `{:ok, pid, state}` where
  `pid` identifies the supervision tree and `state` is the application state.
  `args` is the second element of the tuple given to the `:mod` option.

  The `type` argument passed to `start/2` is usually `:normal` unless in a
  distributed setup where application takeovers and failovers are configured.
  This particular aspect of applications is explained in more detail in the
  OTP documentation:

    * [`:application` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/application.html)
    * [Applications â€“ OTP Design Principles](http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html)

  A developer may also implement the `stop/1` callback (automatically defined
  by `use Application`) which does any application cleanup. It receives the
  application state and can return any value. Note that shutting down the
  supervisor is automatically handled by the VM.

    * `:timeout`    - the timeout for the change (defaults to 5000ms)

  The persistent option can be set to `true` when there is a need to guarantee

  in the application resource file on load. This means persistent values will
  stick after the application is loaded and also on application reload.

  Starts the given `app`.

  If the `app` is not loaded, the application will first be loaded using `load/1`.
  Any included application, defined in the `:included_applications` key of the
  `.app` file will also be loaded, but they won't be started.

  Furthermore, all applications listed in the `:applications` key must be explicitly
  started before this application is. If not, `{:error, {:not_started, app}}` is
  returned, where `app` is the name of the missing application.

  In case you want to automatically  load **and start** all of `app`'s dependencies,
  see `ensure_all_started/2`.

  The `type` argument specifies the type of the application:

    * `:permanent` - if `app` terminates, all other applications and the entire
      node are also terminated.

    * `:transient` - if `app` terminates with `:normal` reason, it is reported
      but no other applications are terminated. If a transient application
      terminates abnormally, all other applications and the entire node are
      also terminated.

    * `:temporary` - if `app` terminates, it is reported but no other
      applications are terminated (the default).

  Note that it is always possible to stop an application explicitly by calling
  `stop/1`. Regardless of the type of the application, no other applications will
  be affected.

  Note also that the `:transient` type is of little practical use, since when a
  supervision tree terminates, the reason is set to `:shutdown`, not `:normal`.
