  Module responsible for doing IO. Many functions in this
  module expects an IO device and an io data encoded in UTF-8.
  Use the bin* functions if the data is binary, useful when
  working with raw bytes or when no unicode conversion should
  be performed.

  An IO device must be a pid or an atom representing a process.
  For convenience, Elixir provides `:stdio` and `:stderr` as
  shortcuts to Erlang's `:standard_io` and `:standard_error`.

  An io data can be:

  * A list of integers representing a string. Any unicode
    character must be represented with one entry in the list,
    this entry being an integer with the codepoint value;

  * A binary in which unicode characters are represented
    with many bytes (Elixir's default representation);

  * A list of binaries or a list of char lists (as described above);
