  A record responsible to hold file information. Its fields are:

  * `size` - Size of file in bytes.
  * `type` - `:device`, `:directory`, `:regular`, `:other`. The type of the file.
  * `access` - `:read`, `:write`, `:read_write`, `:none`. The current system access to
                the file.
  * `atime` - The last time the file was read.
  * `mtime` - The last time the file was written.
  * `ctime` - The interpretation of this time field depends on the operating
              system. On Unix, it is the last time the file or the inode was
              changed. In Windows, it is the create time.
  * `mode` - The file permissions.
  * `links` - The number of links to this file. This is always 1 for file
              systems which have no concept of links.
  * `major_device` - Identifies the file system where the file is located.
                     In windows, the number indicates a drive as follows:
                     0 means A:, 1 means B:, and so on.
  * `minor_device` - Only valid for character devices on Unix. In all other
                     cases, this field is zero.
  * `inode` - Gives the inode number. On non-Unix file systems, this field
              will be zero.
  * `uid` - Indicates the owner of the file.
  * `gid` - Gives the group that the owner of the file belongs to. Will be
            zero for non-Unix file systems.

  The time type returned in `atime`, `mtime`, and `ctime` is dependent on the
  time type set in options. `{:time, type}` where type can be `:local`,
  `:universal`, or `:posix`. Default is `:local`.

defmodule File do
  @moduledoc """
  This module contains functions to manipulate files.

  Some of those functions are low-level, allowing the user
  to interact with the file or IO devices, like `File.open/2`,
  `File.copy/3` and others. This module also provides higher
  level functions that works with filenames and have their naming
  based on UNIX variants. For example, one can copy a file
  via `File.cp/3` and remove files and directories recursively
  via `File.rm_rf/2`

  In order to write and read files, one must use the functions
  in the IO module. By default, a file is opened in binary mode
  which requires the functions `IO.binread`, `IO.binwrite` and
  `IO.binreadline` to interact with the file. A developer may
  pass `:utf8` as an option when opening the file and then all
  other functions from IO are available, since they work directly
  with Unicode data.

  Most of the functions in this module return `:ok` or
  `{ :ok, result }` in case of success, `{ :error, reason }`
  otherwise. Those function are also followed by a variant
  that ends with `!` which returns the result (without the
  `{ :ok, result }` tuple) in case of success or raises an
  exception in case it fails. For example:

      File.read("hello.txt")
      #=> { :ok, "World" }

      File.read("invalid.txt")
      #=> { :error, :enoent }

      File.read!("hello.txt")
      #=> "World"

      File.read!("invalid.txt")
      #=> raises File.Error

  In general, a developer should use the former in case he wants
  to react if the file does not exist. The latter should be used
  when the developer expects his software to fail in case the
  file cannot be read (i.e. it is literally an exception).

  Copies the contents in source to destination.
  Similar to the command `cp -r` in Unix systems,
  this function behaves differently depending
  if `source` and `destination` are a file or a directory.

  If both are files, it simply copies `source` to

  Opens the given `path` according to the given list of modes.

  In order to write and read files, one must use the functions
  in the IO module. By default, a file is opened in binary mode
  which requires the functions `IO.binread`, `IO.binwrite` and
  `IO.binreadline` to interact with the file. A developer may pass
  `:utf8` as an option when opening the file and then all other
  functions from IO are available, since they work directly with
  Unicode data.

  The allowed modes:

  * `:read` - The file, which must exist, is opened for reading.

  * `:write` -  The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not exist.
                If the file exists, and if write is not combined with read, the file will be truncated.

  * `:append` - The file will be opened for writing, and it will be created if it does not exist.
                Every write operation to a file opened with append will take place at the end of the file.

  * `:exclusive` - The file, when opened for writing, is created if it does not exist.
                   If the file exists, open will return { :error, :eexist }.

  * `:charlist` - When this term is given, read operations on the file will return char lists rather than binaries;

  * `:compressed` -  Makes it possible to read or write gzip compressed files.
                     The compressed option must be combined with either read or write, but not both.
                     Note that the file size obtained with `stat/1` will most probably not
                     match the number of bytes that can be read from a compressed file.

  * `:utf8` - This option denotes how data is actually stored in the disk file and
              makes the file perform automatic translation of characters to and from utf-8.
              If data is sent to a file in a format that cannot be converted to the utf-8
              or if data is read by a function that returns data in a format that cannot cope
              with the character range of the data, an error occurs and the file will be closed.

  If a function is given to modes (instead of a list), it dispatches to `open/3`.

  Check `http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/file.html#open-2` for more information about
  other options as `read_ahead` and `delayed_write`.

  This function returns:

  * `{ :ok, io_device }` - The file has been opened in the requested mode.
                         `io_device` is actually the pid of the process which handles the file.
                         This process is linked to the process which originally opened the file.
                         If any process to which the `io_device` is linked terminates, the file will
                         be closed and the process itself will be terminated. An `io_device` returned
                         from this call can be used as an argument to the `IO` module functions.

  * `{ :error, reason }` - The file could not be opened.

  ## Examples

      { :ok, file } = File.open("foo.tar.gz", [:read, :compressed])
      IO.readline(file)
      File.close(file)

  Do not use this function with :delayed_write option
