  A record responsible to hold file information. Its fields are:

  * `size` - Size of file in bytes.
  * `type` - `:device`, `:directory`, `:regular`, `:other`. The type of the file.
  * `access` - `:read`, `:write`, `:read_write`, `:none`. The current system access to
                the file.
  * `atime` - The last time the file was read.
  * `mtime` - The last time the file was written.
  * `ctime` - The interpretation of this time field depends on the operating
              system. On Unix, it is the last time the file or the inode was
              changed. In Windows, it is the create time.
  * `mode` - The file permissions.
  * `links` - The number of links to this file. This is always 1 for file
              systems which have no concept of links.
  * `major_device` - Identifies the file system where the file is located.
                     In windows, the number indicates a drive as follows:
                     0 means A:, 1 means B:, and so on.
  * `minor_device` - Only valid for character devices on Unix. In all other
                     cases, this field is zero.
  * `inode` - Gives the inode number. On non-Unix file systems, this field
              will be zero.
  * `uid` - Indicates the owner of the file.
  * `gid` - Gives the group that the owner of the file belongs to. Will be
            zero for non-Unix file systems.

  The time type returned in `atime`, `mtime`, and `ctime` is dependent on the
  time type set in options. `{:time, type}` where type can be `:local`,
  `:universal`, or `:posix`. Default is `:local`.

defmodule File do
  @moduledoc """
  This module contains function to manipulate files,
  filenames and the filesystem. Many of the functions
  that interact with the filesystem have their naming
  based on its UNIX variants. For example, deleting a
  file is done with `File.rm`. Getting its stats with
  `File.stat`. If you want to read or write to a file
  in chunks, check the IO module.

  Most of the functions in this module return `:ok`
  or `{ :ok, result }` in case of success, `{ :error, reason }`
  otherwise. Those function are also followed by
  a variant that ends with `!` which returns the
  result (without the `{ :ok, result }` tuple) in
  case of success or raises an exception in case it
  fails. For example:

      File.read("hello.txt")
      #=> { :ok, "World" }

      File.read("invalid.txt")
      #=> { :error, :enoent }

      File.read!("hello.txt")
      #=> "World"

      File.read!("invalid.txt")
      #=> raises File.Error

  In general, a developer should use the former in case
  he wants to react in the fie does not exist. The latter
  should be used when the developer expects his software
  to fail in case the file cannot be read (i.e. it is
  literally an exception).

  Finally, the functions in this module accept either
  a char lists or a binary. When manipulating paths, a char
  list is returned if one is given as argument. However,
  when reading files, binaries are always returned.

  Opens the given `path` according to the given list of modes.

  By default, the file is opened in read mode, as a binary with utf8 encoding.

  The allowed modes:

  * `:read` - The file, which must exist, is opened for reading.

  * `:write` -  The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not exist.
                If the file exists, and if write is not combined with read, the file will be truncated.

  * `:append` - The file will be opened for writing, and it will be created if it does not exist.
                Every write operation to a file opened with append will take place at the end of the file.

  * `:exclusive` - The file, when opened for writing, is created if it does not exist.
                   If the file exists, open will return { :error, :eexist }.

  * `:charlist` - When this term is given, read operations on the file will return char lists rather than binaries;

  * `:compressed` -  Makes it possible to read or write gzip compressed files.
                     The compressed option must be combined with either read or write, but not both.
                     Note that the file size obtained with `stat/1` will most probably not
                     match the number of bytes that can be read from a compressed file.

  If a function is given to modes (instead of a list), it dispatches to `open/3`.

  Check `http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/file.html#open-2` for more information about
  other options as `read_ahead` and `delayed_write`.

  This function returns:

  * { :ok, io_device } - The file has been opened in the requested mode.
                         `io_device` is actually the pid of the process which handles the file.
                         This process is linked to the process which originally opened the file.
                         If any process to which the io_device is linked terminates, the file will
                         be closed and the process itself will be terminated. An io_device returned
                         from this call can be used as an argument to the `IO` module functions.

  * { :error, reason } - The file could not be opened.

  ## Examples

      { :ok, file } = File.open("foo.tar.gz", [:read, :compressed])
      IO.readline(file)
      File.close(file)
