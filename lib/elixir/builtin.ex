      defmodule Foo do
        def bar, do: :baz
      end

      Foo.bar #=> :baz

  ## Nesting

  Nesting a module inside the other affects its name:

      defmodule Foo do

        end

  In the example above, two modules `Foo` and `Foo.Bar`. The

  lexical scope. If the module Bar is moved away to another
  file, it needs to be referenced via the full name or a
  reference need to be set with the help of `refer/2`.

  ## Dynamic names

  Elixir module names can be dynamically generated. This is very
  useful for macros. For instance, one could write:

      defmodule binary_to_atom("Foo\#{1}", :utf8) do
        # contents ...
      end

  Elixir will accept any module name as long as the expression
  returns an atom.

  ## Examples

      defmodule Foo do
        def bar, do: :baz
      end

      Foo.bar #=> :baz

  A function that expects arguments can be defined as follow:

      defmodule Foo do
        def sum(a, b) do
          a + b
        end
      end

  In the example above, we defined a function `sum` that receives
  two arguments and sum them.

  ## Dynamic generation with atoms

  Elixir follows the same rule as Erlang when it comes to
  function invocations. Calling a function is the same thing
  as "invoking at atom". That said, we could invoke a function
  named sum in these two equivalent ways:

      sum(1, 2)
      :sum.(1, 2)

  We can also use the atom format to define functions:

      defmodule Foo do
        def :sum.(a, b) do
          a + b
        end
      end

  In general, a developer never needs to use the format above
  except when he wants to dynamically define functions with macros.
  In such scenarios, the name needs to be given dynamically via
  the unquoting mechanism.

  Imagine a macro that receives keywords and defines a function
  for each entry in the keyword, using the key as function name
  and the value as the value returned by the function:

      defmacro defkv(keywords) do
        Enum.map keywords, fn({k,v}) ->
          quote do
            def unquote(k).() do
              unquote(v)
            end
          end
        end
      end

  This macro could be invoked as:

      defkv one: 1, two: 2

  Notice in the example above, we define the function as `def unquote(k).()`
  because each entry `k` is a an atom and invoking `def unquote(k)()`
  would be invalid Elixir syntax.
  """
  defmacro def(name, do: contents)

  @doc """
  This macro allows a function to be defined more explicitly
  by accepting the name, args and guards as different entries.

  Differently from `def/2`, the macro arguments are evaluated
  and therefore requires quoting.

  ## Examples

  The most common mistake when using this macro is to pass the
  arguments without quoting:

      def :some_function, [first_arg, second_arg], is_list(first_arg) do
        # ...
      end

  However, the example above will fail because it will attempt to
  evaluate `[first_arg, second_arg]` and fail because the variable
  `first_arg` is not defined. Therefore, we need to use quote:

      name   = :some_function
      args   = quote(do: [first_arg, second_arg])

  Define a record given by name and values.

  ## Examples

      defrecord FileInfo, atime: nil, mtime: nil

  The line above will define a module named `FileInfo` which
  contains a function named `new` that returns a new record
  and other functions to read and set the values in the
  record. Therefore, we can do:

      file_info = FileInfo.new(atime: now())
      file_info.atime         #=> Returns the value of atime
      file_info.atime(now())  #=> Updates the value of atime

  Internally, a record is simply a tuple where the first element is
  the record module name. This can be noticed if we print the record:

      IO.puts FileInfo.new
      { FileInfo, nil, nil }

  ## Default based functions

  Depending on the default value, Elixir will define helpers to interact
  with the record. For example, ExUnit defines a record which keeps
  track of how many tests were executed and the failures that happened
  The record definition is similar to:

      defrecord Config, counter: 0, failures: []

  Since `counter` is an integer, Elixir automatically defines a helper
  named `increment_counter` that will increase the counter value:

      Config.new.increment_counter.counter #=> 1

  `increment_counter` also accepts a number of increment as argument:

      Config.new.increment_counter(10).counter #=> 10

  Besides, if the default is a list, Elixir will define three helpers:

  * `merge_field` - Receives keywords and merge it into the current value;
  * `prepend_field` - Receives another list and prepend its values

  Defines the current module as a protocol and specifies the API
  that should be implemented.

  ## Examples

  In Elixir, only `false` and `nil` are considered falsy values.
  Everything else evaluates to true in `if` clauses. Depending
  on the application, it may be important to specify a `blank?`
  protocol that returns a boolean for other data types that should
  be considered `blank?`. For instance, an empty list or an empty
  binary could be considered blanks.

  We could implement this protocol as follow:

      defprotocol Blank, [blank?(data)]

  Now that the protocol is defined, we can implement it. We need
  to implement the protocol for each Elixir type. For example:

      # Numbers are never blank
      defimpl Blank, for: Number do
        def blank?(number), do: false
      end

      # Just empty list is blank
      defimpl Blank, for: List do
        def blank?([]), do: true
        def blank?(_),  do: false
      end

      # Just the atoms false and nil are blank
      defimpl Blank, for: Atom do
        def blank?(false), do: true
        def blank?(nil),   do: true
        def blank?(_),     do: false
      end

  And we would have to define the implementation for all types.
  The types available are:

  * Record
  * Tuple
  * Atom
  * List
  * BitString
  * Number
  * Function
  * PID
  * Port
  * Reference
  * Any

  ## Selecting implementations

  Implementing the protocol for all default types can be cumbersome.
  Even more, if you consider that Number, Function, PID, Port and
  Reference are never going to be blank, it would be easier if we
  could simply provide a default implementation.

  This can be achieved with Elixir as follows:

      defprotocol Blank, [blank?(data)], only: [Atom, Tuple, List, BitString, Any]

  If the protocol is invoked with a data type that is not an Atom,
  nor Tuple, nor List, nor BitString, Elixir will now dispatch to
  Any. That said, the default behavior could be implemented as:

      defimpl Blank, for: Any do
        def blank?(_), do: false
      end

  Now, all data types that we have not specified will be
  automatically considered non blank.

  ## Protocols + Records

  The real benefit of protocols comes when mixed with records. For instance,
  imagine we have a module called `RedBlack` that provides an API to create
  and manipulate Red-Black trees. This module represents such trees via a
  record named `RedBlack.Tree` and we want this tree to be considered blank
  in case it has no items. To achieve this, the developer just needs to
  implement the protocol for `RedBlack.Tree`:

      defimpl Blank, for: RedBlack.Tree do
        def blank?(tree), do: RedBlack.empty?(tree)
      end

  In the example above, we have implemented `blank?` for `RedBlack.Tree`
  that simply delegates to `RedBlack.empty?` passing the tree as argument.
  This implementation doesn't need to be defined inside the `RedBlack`
  tree or inside the record, but anywhere in the code.

  Finally, since records are simply tuples, one can add a default protocol
  implementation to any record by defining a default implementation for tuples.

  its previous values. For example:

      i = 1
      case 10 do
      match: i

  The example above will return 20, because `i` is assgined to 10

  The rescue clause is used to handle errors, while the catch clause
  can be used to catch throw values. The catch clause accepts the same
  pattern matching rules as match.

  Note that calls inside `try` are not tail recursive since the VM
  needs to keep the stacktrace in case an exception happens.

  ## Rescue clauses

  While `catch` is simply a pattern matching mechanism, rescue
  provides a higher abstraction around exceptions that allows
  one to rescue an exception by its name and not by its internal
  contents. All the following formats are valid rescue expressions:

      try do
        UndefinedModule.undefined_function
      rescue: UndefinedFunctionError
      end

      try do
        UndefinedModule.undefined_function

  ## Variable visibility

  Since an expression inside `try` may not have been evaluted
  due to an exception, any variable created inside `try` cannot
  be accessed externaly.
  For instance:

      try do
        x = 1
        do_something_that_may_fail(same_arg)
        :ok
      catch: _, _

      x #=> Cannot access `x`

  In the example above, `x` cannot be accessed since it was defined
  inside the `try` clause.

  ## Catching exits and errors

  The catch clause works exactly the same as in Erlang. Therefore,
  one can also handle exits/errors coming from Erlang as below:

      try do
        exit(1)
      catch: :exit, 1
        IO.puts "Exited with 1"
      end

      try do
        error(:sample)

  control mechanisms.

      if(foo, do: bar, else: bar)

  ## Key-value blocks examples

  When several expressions must be passed to if, the most appropriate
  form is thorugh key-value blocks. The first example above would then
  be translated to:

      if foo do
        bar
      end

  Notice that do/end becomes delimiters. The value given between
  do/end becomes the expression given to as `do:`. The second example
  would then translate do:

      if foo do
        bar
      else:
        baz
      end

  Notice that extra keys follows the regular `else:` form. You can also
  add extra `elsif:` clauses:


      if foo do
        bar
      elsif: some_condition
        bar + baz
      else:
        baz
      end

    # Transform the condition and the expressions in the

  Allows you to destructure two lists, assigning each
  term in the right to the left. Differently from pattern
  matching via `=`, if the sizes of the left and right
  lists don't match,, structuring simply stops instead
  of raising an error.

  ## Examples

      destructure [x,y,z], [1,2,3,4,5]
      x #=> 1
      y #=> 2
      z #=> 3

  Notice in the example above, even though the right
  size has more entries than the left, structuring works
  fine. If the right size is smaller, the remaining items
  are simply assigned to nil:

      destructure [x,y,z], [1]
      x #=> 1
      y #=> nil
      z #=> nil

  The left side supports any expression you would use
  on the left side of a match:

      x = 1
      destructure [^x,y,z], [1,2,3]

  The example above will only work if x matches
  the first value from the right side.
