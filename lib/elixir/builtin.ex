  Nesting a module inside the other affects its name:

  In the example above, two modules `Foo` and `Foo.Bar`. The

  lexical scope. If the module Bar is moved away to another
  file, it needs to be referenced via the full name or an
  alias need to be set with the help of `Elixir.SpecialForms.alias/2`.

  ## Dynamic names

  Elixir module names can be dynamically generated. This is very
  useful for macros. For instance, one could write:

      defmodule binary_to_atom("Foo\#{1}", :utf8) do
        # contents ...
      end

  Elixir will accept any module name as long as the expression
  returns an atom.
  """
  defmacro defmodule(name, do: contents)

  @doc """
  Defines a function with the given name and contents.

  ## Examples

      defmodule Foo do
        def bar, do: :baz
      end

      Foo.bar #=> :baz

  A function that expects arguments can be defined as follow:

      defmodule Foo do
        def sum(a, b) do
          a + b
        end
      end

  In the example above, we defined a function `sum` that receives
  two arguments and sum them.

  ## Dynamic generation with atoms

  Elixir follows the same rule as Erlang when it comes to
  function invocations. Calling a function is the same thing
  as "invoking at atom". That said, we could invoke a function
  named sum in these two equivalent ways:

      sum(1, 2)
      :sum.(1, 2)

  We can also use the atom format to define functions:

      defmodule Foo do
        def :sum.(a, b) do
          a + b
        end
      end

  In general, a developer never needs to use the format above
  except when he wants to dynamically define functions with macros.
  In such scenarios, the name needs to be given dynamically via
  the unquoting mechanism.

  Imagine a macro that receives keywords and defines a function
  for each entry in the keyword, using the key as function name
  and the value as the value returned by the function:

      defmacro defkv(keywords) do
        Enum.map keywords, fn {k,v} ->
          quote do
            def unquote(k).() do
              unquote(v)
            end
          end
        end
      end

  This macro could be invoked as:

      defkv one: 1, two: 2

  Notice in the example above, we define the function as `def unquote(k).()`
  because each entry `k` is a an atom and invoking `def unquote(k)()`
  would be invalid Elixir syntax.
  """
  defmacro def(name, do: contents)

  @doc """
  This macro allows a function to be defined more explicitly
  by accepting the name, args and guards as different entries.

  Differently from `def/2`, the macro arguments are evaluated
  and therefore requires quoting.

  The `name` must be an atom, the `arguments` a list where each
  element represents another argument and `guards` a list of
  clauses, where each clause is disjunct.

  ## Examples

  The most common mistake when using this macro is to pass the
  arguments without quoting:

      def :some_function, [first_arg, second_arg], is_list(first_arg) do
        # ...
      end

  However, the example above will fail because it will attempt to
  evaluate `[first_arg, second_arg]` and fail because the variable
  `first_arg` is not defined. Therefore, we need to use quote:

      name   = :some_function
      args   = quote(do: [first_arg, second_arg])
      guards = quote(do: is_list(first_arg))

  Define a record given by name and values.

  ## Examples

      defrecord FileInfo, atime: nil, mtime: nil

  The line above will define a module named `FileInfo` which
  contains a function named `new` that returns a new record
  and other functions to read and set the values in the
  record. Therefore, we can do:

      file_info = FileInfo.new(atime: now())
      file_info.atime         #=> Returns the value of atime
      file_info.atime(now())  #=> Updates the value of atime

  Internally, a record is simply a tuple where the first element is
  the record module name. This can be noticed if we print the record:

      IO.puts FileInfo.new
      { FileInfo, nil, nil }

  ## Default based functions

  Depending on the default value, Elixir will define helpers to interact
  with the record. For example, ExUnit defines a record which keeps
  track of how many tests were executed and the failures that happened
  The record definition is similar to:

      defrecord Config, counter: 0, failures: []

  Since `counter` is an integer, Elixir automatically defines a helper
  named `increment_counter` that will increase the counter value:

      Config.new.increment_counter.counter #=> 1

  `increment_counter` also accepts a number of increment as argument:

      Config.new.increment_counter(10).counter #=> 10

  Besides, if the default is a list, Elixir will define three helpers:

  * `merge_field` - Receives keywords and merge it into the current value;
  * `prepend_field` - Receives another list and prepend its values

  ## Documentation

  By default records are not documented and have @moduledoc set to false.
  This can be changed by passing a moduledoc option after values:

      defrecord Config, [counter: 0, failures: []], moduledoc: "A simple record"

  Defines the current module as a protocol and specifies the API
  that should be implemented.

  ## Examples

  In Elixir, only `false` and `nil` are considered falsy values.
  Everything else evaluates to true in `if` clauses. Depending
  on the application, it may be important to specify a `blank?`
  protocol that returns a boolean for other data types that should
  be considered `blank?`. For instance, an empty list or an empty
  binary could be considered blanks.

  We could implement this protocol as follow:

      defprotocol Blank do
        @doc "Returns true if data is considered blank/empty"
        def blank?(data)
      end

  Now that the protocol is defined, we can implement it. We need
  to implement the protocol for each Elixir type. For example:

      # Numbers are never blank
      defimpl Blank, for: Number do
        def blank?(number), do: false
      end

      # Just empty list is blank
      defimpl Blank, for: List do
        def blank?([]), do: true
        def blank?(_),  do: false
      end

      # Just the atoms false and nil are blank
      defimpl Blank, for: Atom do
        def blank?(false), do: true
        def blank?(nil),   do: true
        def blank?(_),     do: false
      end

  And we would have to define the implementation for all types.
  The types available are:

  * Record
  * Tuple
  * Atom
  * List
  * BitString
  * Number
  * Function
  * PID
  * Port
  * Reference
  * Any

  ## Selecting implementations

  Implementing the protocol for all default types can be cumbersome.
  Even more, if you consider that Number, Function, PID, Port and
  Reference are never going to be blank, it would be easier if we
  could simply provide a default implementation.

  This can be achieved with Elixir as follows:

      defprotocol Blank do
        @only [Atom, Tuple, List, BitString, Any]
        def blank?(data)
      end

  If the protocol is invoked with a data type that is not an Atom,
  nor Tuple, nor List, nor BitString, Elixir will now dispatch to
  Any. That said, the default behavior could be implemented as:

      defimpl Blank, for: Any do
        def blank?(_), do: false
      end

  Now, all data types that we have not specified will be
  automatically considered non blank.

  ## Protocols + Records

  The real benefit of protocols comes when mixed with records. For instance,
  imagine we have a module called `RedBlack` that provides an API to create
  and manipulate Red-Black trees. This module represents such trees via a
  record named `RedBlack.Tree` and we want this tree to be considered blank
  in case it has no items. To achieve this, the developer just needs to
  implement the protocol for `RedBlack.Tree`:

      defimpl Blank, for: RedBlack.Tree do
        def blank?(tree), do: RedBlack.empty?(tree)
      end

  In the example above, we have implemented `blank?` for `RedBlack.Tree`
  that simply delegates to `RedBlack.empty?` passing the tree as argument.
  This implementation doesn't need to be defined inside the `RedBlack`
  tree or inside the record, but anywhere in the code.

  Finally, since records are simply tuples, one can add a default protocol
  implementation to any record by defining a default implementation for tuples.

  In the example above, we compare `thing` with each given
  match clause and execute the first one that matches. If no
  clause matches, an error is raised.

  Since Elixir variables can be assigned more than once, variables
  in a match clause will always be assigned instead of matching with
  its previous values. For example:

      i = 1
      case 10 do
        i -> i * 2
      end

  The example above will return 20, because `i` is assgined to 10
  and then multiplied by 2. If you desire to match the value of `i`
  against the given condition, you need to use the `^` operator:

      i = 1
      case 10 do
        ^i -> i * 2
      end

  The example above will actually fail because 10 does not match 1.

  Finally, `case` accepts an `else:` branch as a fallback if none
  of the clauses match:

      case thing do
        { :selector, i, value } when is_integer(i) ->
          value

      after
        IO.puts "This is printed regardless if it failed or succeed"

  The rescue clause is used to handle errors, while the catch clause
  can be used to catch throw values. Both catch and rescue clauses
  accepts the same pattern matching rules as match.

  Note that calls inside `try` are not tail recursive since the VM
  needs to keep the stacktrace in case an exception happens.

  ## Rescue clauses

  Besides accepting the same pattern matching rules as `match`
  clauses, rescue provides some conveniences around exceptions
  that allows one to rescue an exception by its name and not by
  its internal contents. All the following formats are valid
  rescue expressions:

      try do
        UndefinedModule.undefined_function
      rescue
        UndefinedFunctionError -> nil
      end

      try do

      try do
        UndefinedModule.undefined_function
      rescue
        x -> nil
      end

  ## Variable visibility

  Since an expression inside `try` may not have been evaluted
  due to an exception, any variable created inside `try` cannot
  be accessed externaly.
  For instance:

      try do
        x = 1
        do_something_that_may_fail(same_arg)
        :ok
      catch
        _ | _ -> :failed
      end

      x #=> Cannot access `x`

  In the example above, `x` cannot be accessed since it was defined
  inside the `try` clause.

  ## Catching exits and Erlang errors

  The catch clause works exactly the same as in Erlang. Therefore,
  one can also handle exits/errors coming from Erlang as below:

      try do
        exit(1)
      catch
        :exit, 1 -> IO.puts "Exited with 1"
      end

      try do
        error(:sample)
      catch
        :error, :sample ->

  Access the given element according the qualifier according

  It is important to notice the access protocol is also

  atom aliases. This is useful when working with records to
  allow to match against an specific part of a record:

      def uri_parse(Uri.Config[schema: :http])

  In the example above, the schema clause will only match if
  the config schema is `:http`. Using the access protocol with
  an atom or an atom alias that does not point to a record module
  will generate a compilation exception.

  Defines the given functions in the current module that will
  delegate to the given `target`. Functions defined with
  `defdelegate` are public and are allowed to be invoked
  from external. If you find yourself wishing to define a
  delegation as private, you should likely use import
  instead.

  Delegation only works with functions, delegating to macros
  is not supported.

  ## Options

  * `:to` - The expression to delegate to. Any expression
    is allowed and its results will be calculated on runtime;

  * `:as` - The function to call on the target given in `:to`.
    This parameter is optional and defaults to the name being
    delegated.

  * `:append_first` - If true, when delegated, first argument
    passed to the delegate will be relocated to the end of the
    arguments when dispatched to the target. The motivation behind
    this is a disparity between conventions used in Elixir and Erlang.
    Elixir's convention is to pass the "handle" as a first argument,
    while in Erlang the convention is to pass it as the last argument
