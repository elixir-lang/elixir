# try, catch, and rescue

Elixir has three error mechanisms: errors, throws, and exits. In this chapter, we will explore each of them and include remarks about when each should be used.

## Errors

Errors (or *exceptions*) are used when exceptional things happen in the code. A sample error can be retrieved by trying to add a number to an atom:

```elixir
iex> :foo + 1
** (ArithmeticError) bad argument in arithmetic expression
     :erlang.+(:foo, 1)
```

A runtime error can be raised any time by using `raise/1`:

```elixir
iex> raise "oops"
** (RuntimeError) oops
```

Other errors can be raised with `raise/2` passing the error name and a list of keyword arguments:

```elixir
iex> raise ArgumentError, message: "invalid argument foo"
** (ArgumentError) invalid argument foo
```

You can also define your own errors by creating a module and using the `defexception/1` construct inside it. This way, you'll create an error with the same name as the module it's defined in. The most common case is to define a custom exception with a message field:

```elixir
iex> defmodule MyError do
iex>   defexception message: "default message"
iex> end
iex> raise MyError
** (MyError) default message
iex> raise MyError, message: "custom message"
** (MyError) custom message
```

Errors can be **rescued** using the `try/rescue` construct:

```elixir
iex> try do
...>   raise "oops"
...> rescue
...>   e in RuntimeError -> e
...> end
%RuntimeError{message: "oops"}
```

The example above rescues the runtime error and returns the exception itself, which is then printed in the `iex` session.

If you don't have any use for the exception, you don't have to pass a variable to `rescue`:

```elixir
iex> try do
...>   raise "oops"
...> rescue
...>   RuntimeError -> "Error!"
...> end
"Error!"
```

In practice, Elixir developers rarely use the `try/rescue` construct. For example, many languages would force you to rescue an error when a file cannot be opened successfully. Elixir instead provides a `File.read/1` function which returns a tuple containing information about whether the file was opened successfully:

```elixir
iex> File.read("hello")
{:error, :enoent}
iex> File.write("hello", "world")
:ok
iex> File.read("hello")
{:ok, "world"}
```

There is no `try/rescue` here. In case you want to handle multiple outcomes of opening a file, you can use pattern matching using the `case` construct:

```elixir
iex> case File.read("hello") do
...>   {:ok, body} -> IO.puts("Success: #{body}")
...>   {:error, reason} -> IO.puts("Error: #{reason}")
...> end
```

For the cases where you do expect a file to exist (and the lack of that file is truly an *error*) you may use `File.read!/1`:

```elixir
iex> File.read!("unknown")
** (File.Error) could not read file "unknown": no such file or directory
    (elixir) lib/file.ex:272: File.read!/1
```

At the end of the day, it's up to your application to decide if an error while opening a file is exceptional or not. That's why Elixir doesn't impose exceptions on `File.read/1` and many other functions. Instead, it leaves it up to the developer to choose the best way to proceed.

Many functions in the standard library follow the pattern of having a counterpart that raises an exception instead of returning tuples to match against. The convention is to create a function (`foo`) which returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` tuples and another function (`foo!`, same name but with a trailing `!`) that takes the same arguments as `foo` but which raises an exception if there's an error. `foo!` should return the result (not wrapped in a tuple) if everything goes fine. The `File` module is a good example of this convention.

### Fail fast / Let it crash

One saying that is common in the Erlang community, as well as Elixir's, is "fail fast" / "let it crash". The idea behind let it crash is that, in case something *unexpected* happens, it is best to let the exception happen, without rescuing it.

It is important to emphasize the word *unexpected*. For example, imagine you are building a script to process files. Your script receives filenames as inputs. It is expected that users may make mistakes and provide unknown filenames. In this scenario, while you could use `File.read!/1` to read files and let it crash in case of invalid filenames, it probably makes more sense to use `File.read/1` and provide users of your script with a clear and precise feedback of what went wrong.

Other times, you may fully expect a certain file to exist, and in case it does not, it means something terribly wrong has happened elsewhere. In such cases, `File.read!/1` is all you need.

The second approach also works because, as discussed in the [Processes](processes.md) chapter, all Elixir code runs inside processes that are isolated and don't share anything by default. Therefore, an unhandled exception in a process will never crash or corrupt the state of another process. This allows us to define supervisor processes, which are meant to observe when a process terminates unexpectedly, and start a new one in its place.

At the end of the day, "fail fast" / "let it crash" is a way of saying that, when *something unexpected* happens, it is best to start from scratch within a new process, freshly started by a supervisor, rather than blindly trying to rescue all possible error cases without the full context of when and how they can happen.

### Reraise

While we generally avoid using `try/rescue` in Elixir, one situation where we may want to use such constructs is for observability/monitoring. Imagine you want to log that something went wrong, you could do:

```elixir
try do
  ... some code ...
rescue
  e ->
    Logger.error(Exception.format(:error, e, __STACKTRACE__))
    reraise e, __STACKTRACE__
end
```

In the example above, we rescued the exception, logged it, and then re-raised it. We use the `__STACKTRACE__` construct both when formatting the exception and when re-raising. This ensures we reraise the exception as is, without changing value or its origin.

Generally speaking, we take errors in Elixir literally: they are reserved for unexpected and/or exceptional situations, never for controlling the flow of our code. In case you actually need flow control constructs, *throws* should be used. That's what we are going to see next.

## Throws

In Elixir, a value can be thrown and later be caught. `throw` and `catch` are reserved for situations where it is not possible to retrieve a value unless by using `throw` and `catch`.

Those situations are quite uncommon in practice except when interfacing with libraries that do not provide a proper API. For example, let's imagine the `Enum` module did not provide any API for finding a value and that we needed to find the first multiple of 13 in a list of numbers:

```elixir
iex> try do
...>   Enum.each(-50..50, fn x ->
...>     if rem(x, 13) == 0, do: throw(x)
...>   end)
...>   "Got nothing"
...> catch
...>   x -> "Got #{x}"
...> end
"Got -39"
```

Since `Enum` *does* provide a proper API, in practice `Enum.find/2` is the way to go:

```elixir
iex> Enum.find(-50..50, &(rem(&1, 13) == 0))
-39
```

## Exits

All Elixir code runs inside processes that communicate with each other. When a process dies of "natural causes" (e.g., unhandled exceptions), it sends an `exit` signal. A process can also die by explicitly sending an `exit` signal:

```elixir
iex> spawn_link(fn -> exit(1) end)
** (EXIT from #PID<0.56.0>) shell process exited with reason: 1
```

In the example above, the linked process died by sending an `exit` signal with a value of 1. The Elixir shell automatically handles those messages and prints them to the terminal.

`exit` can also be "caught" using `try/catch`:

```elixir
iex> try do
...>   exit("I am exiting")
...> catch
...>   :exit, _ -> "not really"
...> end
"not really"
```

Using `try/catch` is already uncommon and using it to catch exits is even rarer.

`exit` signals are an important part of the fault tolerant system provided by the Erlang VM. Processes usually run under supervision trees which are themselves processes that listen to `exit` signals from the supervised processes. Once an `exit` signal is received, the supervision strategy kicks in and the supervised process is restarted.

It is exactly this supervision system that makes constructs like `try/catch` and `try/rescue` so uncommon in Elixir. Instead of rescuing an error, we'd rather "fail fast" since the supervision tree will guarantee our application will go back to a known initial state after the error.

## After

Sometimes it's necessary to ensure that a resource is cleaned up after some action that could potentially raise an error. The `try/after` construct allows you to do that. For example, we can open a file and use an `after` clause to close it -- even if something goes wrong:

```elixir
iex> {:ok, file} = File.open("sample", [:utf8, :write])
iex> try do
...>   IO.write(file, "olÃ¡")
...>   raise "oops, something went wrong"
...> after
...>   File.close(file)
...> end
** (RuntimeError) oops, something went wrong
```

The `after` clause will be executed regardless of whether or not the tried block succeeds. Note, however, that if a linked process exits,
this process will exit and the `after` clause will not get run. Thus `after` provides only a soft guarantee. Luckily, files in Elixir are also linked to the current processes and therefore they will always get closed if the current process crashes, independent of the
`after` clause. You will find the same to be true for other resources like ETS tables, sockets, ports and more.

Sometimes you may want to wrap the entire body of a function in a `try` construct, often to guarantee some code will be executed afterwards. In such cases, Elixir allows you to omit the `try` line:

```elixir
iex> defmodule RunAfter do
...>   def without_even_trying do
...>     raise "oops"
...>   after
...>     IO.puts "cleaning up!"
...>   end
...> end
iex> RunAfter.without_even_trying
cleaning up!
** (RuntimeError) oops
```

Elixir will automatically wrap the function body in a `try` whenever one of `after`, `rescue` or `catch` is specified.

## Else

If an `else` block is present, it will match on the results of the `try` block whenever the `try` block finishes without a throw or an error.

```elixir
iex> x = 2
2
iex> try do
...>   1 / x
...> rescue
...>   ArithmeticError ->
...>     :infinity
...> else
...>   y when y < 1 and y > -1 ->
...>     :small
...>   _ ->
...>     :large
...> end
:small
```

Exceptions in the `else` block are not caught. If no pattern inside the `else` block matches, an exception will be raised; this exception is not caught by the current `try/catch/rescue/after` block.

## Variables scope

Similar to `case`, `cond`, `if` and other constructs in Elixir, variables defined inside `try/catch/rescue/after` blocks do not leak to the outer context. In other words, this code is invalid:

```elixir
iex> try do
...>   raise "fail"
...>   what_happened = :did_not_raise
...> rescue
...>   _ -> what_happened = :rescued
...> end
iex> what_happened
** (CompileError) undefined variable "what_happened"
```

Instead, you should return the value of the `try` expression:

```elixir
iex> what_happened =
...>   try do
...>     raise "fail"
...>     :did_not_raise
...>   rescue
...>     _ -> :rescued
...>   end
iex> what_happened
:rescued
```

Furthermore, variables defined in the do-block of `try` are not available inside `rescue/after/else` either. This is because the `try` block may fail at any moment and therefore the variables may have never been bound in the first place. So this also isn't valid:

```elixir
iex> try do
...>   raise "fail"
...>   another_what_happened = :did_not_raise
...> rescue
...>   _ -> another_what_happened
...> end
** (CompileError) undefined variable "another_what_happened"
```

This finishes our introduction on `try`, `catch`, and `rescue`. You will find they are used less frequently in Elixir than in other languages. Next we will talk about a very important subject to Elixir developers: writing documentation.
