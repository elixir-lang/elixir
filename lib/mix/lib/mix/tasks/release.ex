defmodule Mix.Tasks.Release do
  use Mix.Task

  @shortdoc "Assembles a self-contained release"

  @moduledoc """
  Assembles a self-contained release for the current project:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release
      MIX_ENV=prod mix release NAME

  Once a release is assembled, it can be packaged and deployed to a
  target, as long as the target runs on the same operating system (OS)
  distribution and version as the machine running the `mix release`
  command.

  A release can be configured in your `mix.exs` file under the `:releases`
  key inside `def project`:

      def project do
        [
          releases: [
            demo: [
              include_executables_for: [:unix],
              applications: [runtime_tools: :permanent]
            ],

            ...
          ]
        ]
      end

  You can specify multiple releases where the key is the release name
  and the value is a keyword list with the release configuration.
  Releasing a certain name is done with:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release demo

  If the given name does not exist, an error is raised.

  If `mix release`, without a name, is invoked and there are multiple names,
  an error will be raised unless you set `default_release: NAME` at the root
  of your project configuration.

  If `mix release` is invoked and there are no names, a release using the
  application name and default values is assembled.

  ## Why releases?

  Releases allow developers to precompile and package all of their code
  and the runtime into a single unit. The benefits of releases are:

    * Code preloading. The VM has two mechanisms for loading code:
      interactive and embedded. By default, it runs in the interactive
      mode which dynamically loads modules when they are used for the
      first time. The first time your application calls `Enum.map/2`,
      the VM will find the `Enum` module and load it. Thereâ€™s a downside.
      When you start a new server in production, it may need to load
      many other modules, causing the first requests to have an unusual
      spike in response time. Releases run in embedded mode, which loads
      all available modules upfront, guaranteeing your system is ready
      to handle requests after booting.

    * Configuration and customization. Releases give developers fine
      grained control over system configuration and the VM flags used
      to start the system.

    * Self-contained. A release does not require the source code to be
      included in your production artifacts. All of the code is precompiled
      and packaged. Releases do not even require Erlang or Elixir in your
      servers, as it includes the Erlang VM and its runtime by default.
      Furthermore, both Erlang and Elixir standard libraries are stripped
      to bring only the parts you are actually using.

    * Multiple releases. You can assemble different releases with
      different configuration per application or even with different
      applications altogether.

    * Management scripts. Releases come with scripts to start, restart,
      connect to the running system remotely, execute RPC calls, run as
      daemon, run as a Windows service, and more.

  ## Running the release

  Once a release is assembled, you can start it by calling
  `bin/RELEASE_NAME start` inside the release. In production, you would do:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release
      _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start

  `bin/my_app start` will start the system connected to the current standard
  input/output, where logs are also written to by default. This is the
  preferred way to run the system. Many tools, such as `systemd`, platforms
  as a service, such as Heroku, and many containers platforms, such as Docker,
  are capable of processing the standard input/output and redirecting
  the log contents elsewhere. Those tools and platforms also take care
  of restarting the system in case it crashes.

  You can also execute one-off commands, run the release as a daemon on
  Unix-like system, or install it as a service on Windows. We will take a
  look at those next. You can also list all available commands by invoking
  `bin/RELEASE_NAME`.

  ### One-off commands (eval and rpc)

  If you want to invoke specific modules and functions in your release,
  you can do so in two ways: using `eval` or `rpc`.

      bin/RELEASE_NAME eval "IO.puts(:hello)"
      bin/RELEASE_NAME rpc "IO.puts(:hello)"

  The `eval` command starts its own instance of the VM but without
  starting any of the applications in the release and without starting
  distribution. For example, if you need to do some prep work before
  running the actual system, like migrating your database, `eval` can
  be a good fit. Just keep in mind any application you may use during
  eval has to be explicitly loaded and/or started.

  You can start an application by calling `Application.ensure_all_started/1`.
  However, if for some reason you cannot start an application, maybe
  because it will run other services you do not want, you must at least
  load the application by calling `Application.load/1`. If you don't
  load the application, any attempt at reading its environment or
  configuration may fail. Note that if you start an application,
  it is automatically loaded before started.

  Another way to run commands is with `rpc`, which will connect to the
  system currently running and instruct it to execute the given
  expression. This means you need to guarantee the system was already
  started and be careful with the instructions you are executing.
  You can also use `remote` to connect a remote IEx session to the
  system.

  #### Helper module

  As you operate your system, you may find yourself running some piece of code
  as a one-off command quite often. You may consider creating a module to group
  these tasks:

      # lib/my_app/release_tasks.ex
      defmodule MyApp.ReleaseTasks do
        def eval_purge_stale_data() do
          # Eval commands needs to start the app before
          # Or Application.load(:my_app) if you can't start it
          Application.ensure_all_started(:my_app)

          # Code that purges stale data
          ...
        end

        def rpc_print_connected_users() do
          # Code that print users connected to the current running system
          ...
        end
      end

  In the example above, we prefixed the function names with the command
  name used to execute them, but that is entirely optional.

  And to run them:

      bin/RELEASE_NAME eval "MyApp.ReleaseTasks.eval_purge_stale_data()"
      bin/RELEASE_NAME rpc "MyApp.ReleaseTasks.rpc_print_connected_users()"

  ### Daemon mode (Unix-like)

  You can run the release in daemon mode with the command:

      bin/RELEASE_NAME daemon_iex

  In daemon mode, the system is started on the background via
  [run_erl](http://erlang.org/doc/man/run_erl.html). You may also
  want to enable [heart](http://erlang.org/doc/man/heart.html)
  in daemon mode so it automatically restarts the system in case
  of crashes. See the generated `releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh` file.

  The daemon will write all of its standard output to the "tmp/log/"
  directory in the release root. A developer can also attach
  to the standard input of the daemon by invoking "to_erl tmp/pipe/"
  from the release root. However, note that attaching to the system
  should be done with extreme care, since the usual commands for
  exiting an Elixir system, such as hitting Ctrl+C twice or Ctrl+\\,
  will actually shut down the daemon. Therefore, using
  `bin/RELEASE_NAME remote` should be preferred, even in daemon mode.

  You can customize the tmp directory used both for logging and for
  piping in daemon mode by setting the `RELEASE_TMP` environment
  variable. See the "Customization" section.

  ### Services mode (Windows)

  While daemons are not available on Windows, it is possible to install a
  released system as a service on Windows with the help of
  [erlsrv](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlsrv.html). This can be done by
  running:

      bin/RELEASE_NAME install

  Once installed, the service must be explicitly managed via the `erlsrv`
  executable, which is included in the `erts-VSN/bin` directory.
  The service is not started automatically after installing.

  For example, if you have a release named `demo`, you can install
  the service and then start it from the release root as follows:

      bin/demo install
      erts-VSN/bin/erlsrv.exs start demo_demo

  The name of the service is `demo_demo` because the name is built
  by concatenating the node name with the release name. Since Elixir
  automatically uses the same name for both, the service will be
  referenced as `demo_demo`.

  The `install` command must be executed as an administrator.

  ### `bin/RELEASE_NAME` commands

  The following commands are supported by `bin/RELEASE_NAME`:

      start        Starts the system
      start_iex    Starts the system with IEx attached
      daemon       Starts the system as a daemon (Unix-like only)
      daemon_iex   Starts the system as a daemon with IEx attached (Unix-like only)
      install      Installs this system as a Windows service (Windows only)
      eval "EXPR"  Executes the given expression on a new, non-booted system
      rpc "EXPR"   Executes the given expression remotely on the running system
      remote       Connects to the running system via a remote shell
      restart      Restarts the running system via a remote command
      stop         Stops the running system via a remote command
      pid          Prints the operating system PID of the running system via a remote command
      version      Prints the release name and version to be booted

  ## Deployments

  ### Requirements

  A release is built on a **host**, a machine which contains Erlang, Elixir,
  and any other dependencies needed to compile your application. A release is
  then deployed to a **target**, potentially the same machine as the host,
  but usually separate, and often there are many targets (either multiple
  instances, or the release is deployed to heterogeneous environments).

  To deploy straight from a host to a separate target without cross-compilation,
  the following must be the same between the host and the target:

    * Target architecture (for example, x86_64 or ARM)
    * Target vendor + operating system  (for example, Windows, Linux, or Darwin/macOS)
    * Target ABI (for example, musl or gnu)

  This is often represented in the form of target triples, for example,
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`.

  So to be more precise, to deploy straight from a host to a separate target,
  the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), and any native dependencies (NIFs), must
  be compiled for the same target triple. If you are building on a MacBook
  (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) and trying to deploy to a typical Ubuntu machine
  (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`), the release will not work. Instead you should
  build the release on a `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` host. As we will see, this
  can be done in multiple ways, such as releasing on the target itself, or by
  using virtual machines or containers, usually as part of your release pipeline.

  In addition to matching the target triple, it is also important that the
  target has all of the system packages that your application will need at
  runtime. A common one is the need for OpenSSL when building an application
  that uses `:crypto` or `:ssl`, which is dynamically linked to ERTS. The other
  common source for native dependencies like this comes from dependencies
  containing NIFs (natively-implemented functions) which may expect to
  dynamically link to libraries they use.

  Of course, some operating systems and package managers can differ between
  versions, so if your goal is to have full compatibility between host and
  target, it is best to ensure the operating system and system package manager
  have the same versions on host and target. This may even be a requirement in
  some systems, especially so with package managers that try to create fully
  reproducible environments (Nix, Guix).

  Alternatively, you can also bundle the compiled object files in the release,
  as long as they were compiled for the same target. If doing so, you need to
  update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the paths containing the bundled objects.

  Currently, there is no official way to cross-compile a release from one
  target triple to another, due to the complexities involved in the process.

  ### Techniques

  There are a couple of ways to guarantee that a release is built on a host with
  the same properties as the target. A simple option is to fetch the source,
  compile the code and assemble the release on the target itself. It would
  be something like this:

      git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source
      cd my_app_source
      mix deps.get --only prod
      MIX_ENV=prod mix release
      _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/my_app start

  If you prefer, you can also compile the release to a separate directory,
  so you can erase all source after the release is assembled:

      git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source
      cd my_app_source
      mix deps.get --only prod
      MIX_ENV=prod mix release --path ../my_app_release
      cd ../my_app_release
      rm -rf ../my_app_source
      bin/my_app start

  However, this option can be expensive if you have multiple production
  nodes or if the release assembling process is a long one, as each node
  needs to individually assemble the release.

  You can automate this process in a couple different ways. One option
  is to make it part of your Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous
  Deployment (CD) pipeline. When you have a CI/CD pipeline, it is common
  that the machines in your CI/CD pipeline run on the exact same target
  triple as your production servers (if they don't, they should).
  In this case, you can assemble the release at the end of your CI/CD
  pipeline by calling `MIX_ENV=prod mix release` and push the artifact
  to S3 or any other network storage. To perform the deployment, your
  production machines can fetch the deployment from the network storage
  and run `bin/my_app start`.

  Another mechanism to automate deployments is to use images, such as
  Amazon Machine Images, or container platforms, such as Docker.
  For instance, you can use Docker to run locally a system with the
  exact same target triple as your production servers. Inside the
  container, you can invoke `MIX_ENV=prod mix release` and build
  a complete image and/or container with the operating system, all
  dependencies as well as the releases.

  In other words, there are multiple ways systems can be deployed and
  releases can be automated and incorporated into all of them as long
  as you remember to build the system in the same target triple.

  Once a system is deployed, shutting down the system can be done by
  sending SIGINT/SIGTERM to the system, which is what most containers,
  platforms and tools do, or by explicitly invoking `bin/RELEASE_NAME stop`.
  Once the system receives the shutdown request, each application and
  their respective supervision trees will stop, one by one, in the
  opposite order that they were started.

  ## Customization

  There are a couple ways in which developers can customize the generated
  artifacts inside a release.

  ### Options

  The following options can be set inside your mix.exs on each release definition:

    * `:applications` - a keyword list that configures and adds new applications
      to the release. The key is the application name and the value is one of:

        * `:permanent` - the application is started and the node shuts down
          if the application terminates, regardless of reason
        * `:transient` - the application is started and the node shuts down
          if the application terminates abnormally
        * `:temporary` - the application is started and the node does not
          shut down if the application terminates
        * `:load` - the application is only loaded
        * `:none` - the application is part of the release but it is neither loaded nor
          started

      All applications default to `:permanent`.

      By default `:applications` includes the current application and all
      applications the current application depends on, recursively.
      You can include new applications or change the mode of
      existing ones by listing them here. The order of the applications given
      in `:applications` will be preserved as much as possible, with only
      `:kernel`, `:stdlib`, `:sasl`, and `:elixir` listed before the given
      application list.

      Releases assembled from an umbrella project require this configuration
      to be explicitly given.

    * `:strip_beams` - a boolean that controls if BEAM files should have their debug
      information, documentation chunks, and other non-essential metadata removed.
      Defaults to `true`.

    * `:cookie` - a string representing the Erlang Distribution cookie. If this
      option is not set, a random cookie is  written to the `releases/COOKIE` file
      when the first release is assembled. At runtime, we will first attempt
      to fetch the cookie from the `RELEASE_COOKIE` environment variable and
      then we'll read the `releases/COOKIE` file.

      If you are setting this option manually, we recommend the cookie option
      to be a long and randomly generated string, such as:
      `Base.url_encode64(:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(40))`. We also recommend to restrict
      the characters in the cookie to the subset returned by `Base.url_encode64/1`.

    * `:path` - the path the release should be installed to.
      Defaults to `"_build/MIX_ENV/rel/RELEASE_NAME"`.

    * `:version` - the release version as a string or `{:from_app, app_name}`.
      Defaults to the current application version. The `{:from_app, app_name}` format
      can be used to easily reference the application version from another application.
      This is particularly useful in umbrella applications.

    * `:quiet` - a boolean that controls if releases should write steps to
      the standard output. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:include_erts` - a boolean, string, or anonymous function of arity zero.
      If a boolean, it indicates whether the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), which
      includes the Erlang VM, should be included in the release. The default is
      `true`, which is also the recommended value. If a string, it represents
      the path to an existing ERTS installation. If an anonymous function of
      arity zero, it's a function that returns any of the above (boolean or string).

      You may also set this option to `false` if you desire to use the ERTS version installed
      on the target. Note, however, that the ERTS version on the target must have **the
      exact version** as the ERTS version used when the release is assembled. Setting it to
      `false` also disables hot code upgrades. Therefore, `:include_erts` should be
      set to `false` with caution and only if you are assembling the release on the
      same server that runs it.

    * `:include_executables_for` - a list of atoms detailing for which Operating
      Systems executable files should be generated for. By default, it is set to
      `[:unix, :windows]`. You can customize those as follows:

          releases: [
            demo: [
              include_executables_for: [:unix] # Or [:windows] or []
            ]
          ]

    * `:steps` - a list of steps to execute when assembling the release. See
      the "Steps" section for more information.

  Besides the options above, it is possible to customize the generated
  release with custom template files or by tweaking the release steps.
  We will detail both approaches next.

  ### vm.args and env.sh (env.bat)

  Developers may want to customize the VM flags and environment variables
  given when the release starts. This is typically done by customizing
  two files inside your release: `releases/RELEASE_VSN/vm.args` and
  `releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh` (or `env.bat` on Windows).

  However, instead of modifying those files after the release is built,
  the simplest way to customize those files is by running `mix release.init`.
  The Mix task will copy custom `rel/vm.args.eex`, `rel/env.sh.eex`, and
  `rel/env.bat.eex` files to your project root. You can modify those
  files and they will be evaluated every time you perform a new release.
  Those files are regular EEx templates and they have a single assign,
  called `@release`, with the `Mix.Release` struct.

  The `vm.args` file may contain any of the VM flags accepted by the [`erl`
  command](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html).

  The `env.sh` and `env.bat` is used to set environment variables.
  In there, you can set vars such as `RELEASE_NODE`, `RELEASE_COOKIE`,
  and `RELEASE_TMP` to customize your node name, cookie and tmp
  directory respectively. Whenever `env.sh` or `env.bat` is invoked,
  the variables `RELEASE_ROOT`, `RELEASE_NAME`, `RELEASE_VSN`, and
  `RELEASE_COMMAND` have already been set, so you can rely on them.
  See the section on environment variables for more information.

  Furthermore, while `vm.args` is static, you can use `env.sh` and
  `env.bat` to dynamically set VM options. For example, if you want
  to make sure the Erlang Distribution listens only on a given port
  known at runtime, you can set the following:

      case $RELEASE_COMMAND in
        start*|daemon*)
          ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="-kernel inet_dist_listen_min $BEAM_PORT inet_dist_listen_max $BEAM_PORT"
          export ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS
          ;;
        *)
          ;;
      esac

  Note we only set the port on start/daemon commands. If you also limit
  the port on other commands, such as `rpc`, then you will be unable
  to establish a remote connection as the port will already be in use
  by the node.

  On Windows, your `env.bat` would look like this:

      IF NOT %RELEASE_COMMAND:start=%==%RELEASE_COMMAND% (
        set ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="-kernel inet_dist_listen_min %BEAM_PORT% inet_dist_listen_max %BEAM_PORT%"
      )

  ### Steps

  It is possible to add one or more steps before and after the release is
  assembled. This can be done with the `:steps` option:

      releases: [
        demo: [
          steps: [&set_configs/1, :assemble, &copy_extra_files/1]
        ]
      ]

  The `:steps` option must be a list and it must always include the
  atom `:assemble`, which does most of the release assembling. You
  can pass anonymous functions before and after the `:assemble` to
  customize your release assembling pipeline. Those anonymous functions
  will receive a `Mix.Release` struct and must return the same or
  an updated `Mix.Release` struct. It is also possible to build a tarball
  of the release by passing the `:tar` step anywhere after `:assemble`.
  The tarball is created in `_build/MIX_ENV/RELEASE_NAME-RELEASE_VSN.tar.gz`

  See `Mix.Release` for more documentation on the struct and which
  fields can be modified. Note that `:steps` field itself can be
  modified and it is updated every time a step is called. Therefore,
  if you need to execute a command before and after assembling the
  release, you only need to declare the first steps in your pipeline
  and then inject the last step into the release struct. The steps
  field can also be used to verify if the step was set before or
  after assembling the release.

  ## Application configuration

  Releases provides two mechanisms for configuring OTP applications:
  build-time and runtime.

  ### Build-time configuration

  Whenever you invoke a `mix` command, Mix loads the configuration
  in `config/config.exs`, if said file exists. It is common for the
  `config/config.exs` file itself to import other configuration based
  on the current `MIX_ENV`, such as `config/dev.exs`, `config/test.exs`,
  and `config/prod.exs`. We say that this configuration is a build-time
  configuration as it is evaluated whenever you compile your code or
  whenever you assemble the release.

  In other words, if your configuration does something like:

      config :my_app, :secret_key, System.fetch_env!("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")

  The `:secret_key` key under `:my_app` will be computed on the
  host machine, whenever the release is built. Setting the
  `MY_APP_SECRET_KEY` right before starting your release will have
  no effect.

  Luckily, releases also provide runtime configuration, which we will
  see next.

  ### Runtime configuration

  To enable runtime configuration in your release, all you need to do is
  to create a file named `config/releases.exs`:

      import Config
      config :my_app, :secret_key, System.fetch_env!("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")

  Your `config/releases.exs` file needs to follow three important rules:

    * It MUST `import Config` at the top instead of the deprecated `use Mix.Config`
    * It MUST NOT import any other configuration file via `import_file`
    * It MUST NOT access `Mix` in any way, as `Mix` is a build tool and it not
      available inside releases

  If a `config/releases.exs` exists, it will be copied to your release
  and executed early in the boot process, when only Elixir and Erlang's
  main applications have been started. Once the configuration is loaded,
  the Erlang system will be restarted (within the same Operating System
  process) and the new configuration will take place.

  You can change the path to the runtime configuration file by setting
  `:runtime_config_path`. This path is resolved at build time as the
  given configuration file is always copied to inside the release.

  Finally, in order for runtime configuration to work properly (as well
  as any other "Config provider" as defined next), it needs to be able
  to persist the newly computed configuration to disk. The computed config
  file will be written to "tmp" directory inside the release every time
  the system boots. You can configure the "tmp" directory by setting the
  `RELEASE_TMP` environment variable, either explicitly or inside your
  `releases/RELEASE_VSN/env.sh` (or `env.bat` on Windows).

  ### Config providers

  Releases also supports custom mechanisms, called config providers, to load
  any sort of runtime configuration to the system while it boots. For instance,
  if you need to access a vault or load configuration from a JSON file, it
  can be achieved with config providers. The runtime configuration outlined
  in the previous section, which is handled by the `Config.Reader` provider.
  See the `Config.Provider` module for more information and more examples.

  The following options can be set inside your releases key in your `mix.exs`
  to control how config providers work:

    * `:start_distribution_during_config` - on Erlang/OTP 22+, releases
      only start the Erlang VM distribution features after the config files
      are evaluated. You can set it to `true` if you need distribution during
      configuration. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:prune_runtime_sys_config_after_boot` - every time your system boots,
      the release will write a config file to your tmp directory. These
      configuration files are generally small. But if you are concerned with
      disk space or if you have other restrictions, you can ask the system to
      remove said config files after boot. The downside is that you will no
      longer be able to restart the system internally (neither via
      `System.restart/0` nor `bin/RELEASE_NAME start`). If you need a restart,
      you will have to terminate the Operating System process and start a new
      one. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:config_providers` - a list of tuples with custom config providers.
      See `Config.Provider` for more information. Defaults to `[]`.

  ### Customization and configuration summary

  Generally speaking, the following files are available for customizing
  and configuring the running system:

    * `config/config.exs` (and `config/prod.exs`) - provides build-time
      application configuration, which are executed when the release is
      assembled

    * `config/releases.exs` - provides runtime application configuration.
      It is executed every time the release boots and is further extensible
      via config providers

    * `rel/vm.args.eex` - a template file that is copied into every release
      and provides static configuration of the Erlang Virtual Machine and
      other runtime flags

    * `rel/env.sh.eex` and `rel/env.bat.eex` - template files that are copied
      into every release and are executed on every command to set up environment
      variables, including specific ones to the VM, and the general environment

  ## Directory structure

  A release is organized as follows:

      bin/
        RELEASE_NAME
      erts-ERTS_VSN/
      lib/
        APP_NAME-APP_VSN/
          ebin/
          include/
          priv/
      releases/
        RELEASE_VSN/
          consolidated/
          elixir
          elixir.bat
          env.bat
          env.sh
          iex
          iex.bat
          releases.exs
          start.boot
          start.script
          start_clean.boot
          start_clean.script
          sys.config
          vm.args
        COOKIE
        start_erl.data
      tmp/

  ## Environment variables

  The system sets different environment variables. The following variables
  are set early on and can only be read by `env.sh` and `env.bat`:

    * `RELEASE_ROOT` - points to the root of the release. If the system
      includes ERTS, then it is the same as `:code.root_dir/0`. This
      variable is always computed and it cannot be set to a custom value

    * `RELEASE_COMMAND` - the command given to the release, such as `"start"`,
      `"remote"`, `"eval"`, and so on. This is typically accessed inside `env.sh`
      and `env.bat` to set different environment variables under different
      conditions. Note, however, that `RELEASE_COMMAND` has not been
      validated by the time `env.sh` and `env.bat` are called, so it may
      be empty or contain invalid values. This variable is always computed
      and it cannot be set to a custom value

    * `RELEASE_NAME` - the name of the release. It can be set to a custom
      value when invoking the release

    * `RELEASE_VSN` - the version of the release, otherwise the latest
      version is used. It can be set to a custom value when invoking the
      release. The custom value must be an existing release version in
      the `releases/` directory

  The following variables can be set before you invoke the release or
  inside `env.sh` and `env.bat`:

    * `RELEASE_COOKIE` - the release cookie. By default uses the value
      in `releases/COOKIE`. It can be set to a custom value

    * `RELEASE_NODE` - the release node name, in the format `name@host`.
      It can be set to a custom value. The name part must be made only
      of letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens

    * `RELEASE_VM_ARGS` - the location of the vm.args file. It can be set
      to a custom path

    * `RELEASE_TMP` - the directory in the release to write temporary
      files to. It can be set to a custom directory. It defaults to
      `$RELEASE_ROOT/tmp`

    * `RELEASE_MODE` - if the release should start in embedded or
      interactive mode. Defaults to "embedded". It applies only to
      start/daemon/install commands

    * `RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION` - how do we want to run the distribution.
      May be `name` (long names), `sname` (short names) or `none`
      (distribution is not started automatically). Defaults to
      `sname` which allows access only within the current system.
      `name` allows external connections. If `name` is used and you are
      not running on Erlang/OTP 22 or later, you must set `RELEASE_NODE`
      to `RELEASE_NAME@127.0.0.1` with an IP or a known host

    * `RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT` - the name of the boot script to use when starting
      the release. This script is used when running commands such as `start` and
      `daemon`. The boot script is expected to be located at the
      path `releases/RELEASE_VSN/RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT.boot`. Defaults to `start`

    * `RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT_CLEAN` - the name of the boot script used when
      starting the release clean, without your application or its dependencies.
      This script is used by commands such as `eval`, `rpc`, and `remote`.
      The boot script is expected to be located at the path
      `releases/RELEASE_VSN/RELEASE_BOOT_SCRIPT_CLEAN.boot`. Defaults
      to `start_clean`

  ## Umbrellas

  Releases are well integrated with umbrella projects, allowing you to
  release one or more subsets of your umbrella children. The only difference
  between performing a release in the umbrella project compared to a
  regular application is that umbrellas require you to explicitly list
  your release and the starting point for each release. For example,
  imagine this umbrella applications:

      my_app_umbrella/
        apps/
          my_app_core/
          my_app_event_processing/
          my_app_web/

  where both `my_app_event_processing` and `my_app_web` depend on
  `my_app_core` but they do not depend on each other.

  Inside your umbrella, you can define multiple releases:

      releases: [
        web_and_event_processing: [
          applications: [
            my_app_event_processing: :permanent,
            my_app_web: :permanent
          ]
        ],

        web_only: [
          applications: [my_app_web: :permanent]
        ],

        event_processing_only: [
          applications: [my_app_event_processing: :permanent]
        ]
      ]

  Note you don't need to define all applications in `:applications`,
  only the entry points. Also remember that the recommended mode
  for all applications in the system is `:permanent`.

  Finally, keep in mind it is not required for you to assemble the
  release from the umbrella root. You can also assemble the release
  from each child application individually. Doing it from the root,
  however, allows you to include two applications that do not depend
  on each other as part of the same release.

  ## Hot Code Upgrades

  Erlang and Elixir are sometimes known for the capability of upgrading
  a node that is running in production without shutting down that node.
  However, this feature is not supported out of the box by Elixir releases.

  The reason we don't provide hot code upgrades is because they are very
  complicated to perform in practice, as they require careful coding of
  your processes and applications as well as extensive testing. Given most
  teams can use other techniques that are language agnostic to upgrade
  their systems, such as Blue/Green deployments, Canary deployments,
  Rolling deployments, and others, hot upgrades are rarely a viable
  option. Let's understand why.

  In a hot code upgrade, you want to update a node from version A to
  version B. To do so, the first step is to write recipes for every application
  that changed between those two releases, telling exactly how the application
  changed between versions, those recipes are called `.appup` files.
  While some of the steps in building `.appup` files can be automated,
  not all of them can. Furthermore, each process in the application needs
  to be explicitly coded with hot code upgrades in mind. Let's see an example.
  Imagine your application has a counter process as a GenServer:

      defmodule Counter do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def bump do
          GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :bump)
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(:ok) do
          {:ok, 0}
        end

        def handle_call(:bump, counter) do
          {:reply, :ok, counter + 1}
        end
      end

  You add this process as part of your supervision tree and ship version
  0.1.0 of your system. Now let's imagine that on version 0.2.0 you added
  two changes: instead of `bump/0`, that always increments the counter by
  one, you introduce `bump/1` that passes the exact value to bump the
  counter. You also change the state, because you want to store the maximum
  bump value:

      defmodule Counter do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def bump(by) do
          GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:bump, by})
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(:ok) do
          {:ok, {0, 0}}
        end

        def handle_call({:bump, by}, {counter, max}) do
          {:reply, :ok, {counter + by, max(max, by)}}
        end
      end

  If you to perform a hot code upgrade in such application, it would
  crash, because in the initial version the state was just a counter
  but in the new version the state is a tuple. Furthermore, you changed
  the format of the `call` message from `:bump` to  `{:bump, by}` and
  the process may have both old and new messages temporarily mixed, so
  we need to handle both. The final version would be:

      defmodule Counter do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def bump(by) do
          GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:bump, by})
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(:ok) do
          {:ok, {0, 0}}
        end

        def handle_call(:bump, {counter, max}) do
          {:reply, :ok, {counter + 1, max(max, 1)}}
        end

        def handle_call({:bump, by}, {counter, max}) do
          {:reply, :ok, {counter + by, max(max, by)}}
        end

        def code_change(_, counter, _) do
          {:ok, {counter, 0}}
        end
      end

  Now you can proceed to list this process in the `.appup` file and
  hot code upgrade it. This is one of the many steps necessary
  to perform hot code upgrades and it must be taken into account by
  every process and application being upgraded in the system.
  The [`.appup` cookbook](http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/appup_cookbook.html)
  provides a good reference and more examples.

  Once `.appup`s are created, the next step is to create a `.relup`
  file with all instructions necessary to update the release itself.
  Erlang documentation does provide a chapter on
  [Creating and Upgrading a Target System](http://erlang.org/doc/system_principles/create_target.html).
  [Learn You Some Erlang has a chapter on hot code upgrades](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/relups).

  Overall, there are many steps, complexities and assumptions made
  during hot code upgrades, which is ultimately why they are not
  provided by Elixir out of the box. However, hot code upgrades can
  still be achieved by teams who desire to implement those steps
  on top of `mix release` in their projects or as separate libraries.
