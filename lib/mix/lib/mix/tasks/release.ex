defmodule Mix.Tasks.Release do
  @moduledoc """
  Assembles a release for the current project:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release
      MIX_ENV=prod mix release NAME

  Once a release is assembled, it can be packaged and deployed to a
  target, as long as the target runs on the same operating system (OS)
  distribution and version as the machine running the `mix release`
  command.

  A release can be configured in your `mix.exs` file under the `:releases`
  key inside `def project`:

      def project do
        [
          releases: [
            demo: [
              include_executables_for: [:unix],
              applications: [runtime_tools: :permanent]
            ],

            ...
          ]
        ]
      end

  You can specify multiple releases where the key is the release name
  and the value is a keyword list with the release configuration.
  Releasing a certain name is done with:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release demo

  If the given name does not exist, an error is raised.

  If `mix release`, without a name, is invoked and there are multiple names,
  an error will be raised unless you set `default_release: NAME` at the root
  of your project configuration.

  If `mix release` is invoked and there are no names, a release using the
  application name and default values is assembled.

  ## Running the release

  Once a release is assembled, you can start it by calling `bin/start`
  inside the release. In production, you would do:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release
      _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/start

  `bin/start` is a very short script that invokes the proper instruction
  on `bin/RELEASE_NAME`. You can customize `bin/start` in any way you want,
  but you are not supposed to change `bin/RELEASE_NAME`.

  `bin/start` will start the system connected to the current standard
  input/output, where logs are also written to by default. This is the
  preferred way to run the system. Many tools, such as `systemd`, platforms
  as a service, such as Heroku, and many containers platforms, such as Docker,
  are capable of processing the standard input/output and redirecting
  the log contents elsewhere. Those tools and platforms also take care
  of restarting the system in case it crashes.

  For those looking for alternate ways of running the system, you can
  run it as a daemon on Unix-like system or install it as a service on
  Windows.

  ### Daemon mode (Unix-like)

  If you open up `bin/start`, you will also see there is an option to
  run the release in daemon mode written as a comment:

      bin/RELEASE_NAME daemon iex

  In daemon mode, the system is started on the background via
  [run_erl](http://erlang.org/doc/man/run_erl.html). Running in
  daemon mode also allows developers to enable [heart](http://erlang.org/doc/man/heart.html)
  by adding `-heart` to their vm.args file (see a later section
  on customizing vm.args). `heart` automatically restarts the
  system in case it crashes.

  The daemon will write all of its standard output to the "tmp/log/"
  directory in the release root. A developer can also attach
  to the standard input of the daemon by invoking "to_erl tmp/pipe/"
  from the release root. However, note that attaching to the system
  should be done with extreme care, since the usual commands for
  exiting an Elixir system, such as hitting Ctrl+C twice or Ctrl+\\,
  whill actually shut down the daemon. Therefore, using
  `bin/RELEASE_NAME remote` should be preferred, even in daemon mode.

  You can customize the tmp directory used both for logging and for piping
  in daemon mode by setting the `RELEASE_TMP` environment variable before
  starting the system.

  ### Services mode

  While daemons are not available on Windows, it is possible to install a
  released system as a service on Windows with the help of
  [erlsrv](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlsrv.html). This can be done by
  running:

      bin/RELEASE_NAME install

  Once installed, the service must be explicitly managed via the `erlsrv`
  executable, which is included in the `erts-VSN/bin` directory.
  The service is not started automatically after installing.

  For example, if you have a release named `demo`, you can install
  the service and then start it from the release root as follows:

      bin/demo install
      erts-VSN/bin/erlsrv.exs start demo_demo

  The name of the service is `demo_demo` because the name is built
  by concatenating the node name with the release name. Since Elixir
  automatically uses the same name for both, the service will be
  referenced as `demo_demo`.

  The `install` command must be executed as an administrator.

  ## Deployments

  ### Requirements

  A release is built on a **host**, a machine which contains Erlang, Elixir,
  and any other dependencies needed to compile your application. A release is
  then deployed to a **target**, potentially the same machine as the host,
  but usually separate, and often there are many targets (either multiple
  instances, or the release is deployed to heterogeneous environments).

  To deploy straight from a host to a separate target without cross-compilation,
  the following must be the same between the host and the target:

    * Target architecture (e.g. x86_64 vs ARM)
    * Target Vendor+OS (e.g. Windows, Linux, Darwin/macOS)
    * Target ABI (e.g. musl, gnu)

  This is often represented in the form of target triples, e.g.
  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, x86_64-unknown-linux-musl, x86_64-apple-darwin.

  So to be more precise, to deploy straight from a host to a separate target,
  the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS), and any native dependencies (NIFs), must
  be compiled for the same target triple. If you are building on a MacBook
  (x86_64-apple-darwin) and trying to deploy to a typical Ubuntu machine
  (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu), the release will not work. Instead you should
  build the release on a x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu host. As we will see, this
  can be done in multiple ways, such as releasing on the target itself, or by
  using virtual machines or containers, usually as part of your release pipeline.

  In addition to matching the target triple, it is also important that the
  target has all of the system packages that your application will need at
  runtime. A common one is the need for OpenSSL when building an application
  that uses `:crypto` or `:ssl, which is dynamically linked to ERTS. The other
  common source for native dependencies like this comes from dependencies
  containing NIFs (natively-implemented functions) which may expect to
  dynamically link to libraries they use.

  These system packages are typically managed using the system package manager,
  but if necessary, you can also bundle the compiled object files in the release,
  as long as they were compiled for the same target. If doing so, you need to
  update LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the paths containing the bundled objects.

  Currently, there is no official way to cross-compile a release from one
  target triple to another, due to the complexities involved in the process.

  ### Techniques

  There a couple ways to guarantee that a release is built on a host with
  the same properties as the target. A simple option is to fetch the source,
  compile the code and assemble the release on the target itself. It would
  be something like this:

      git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source
      cd my_app_source
      mix deps.get --only prod
      MIX_ENV=prod mix release
      _build/prod/rel/my_app/bin/start

  If you prefer, you can also compile the release to a separate directory,
  so you can erase all source after the release is assembled:

      git clone remote://path/to/my_app.git my_app_source
      cd my_app_source
      mix deps.get --only prod
      MIX_ENV=prod mix release --path ../my_app_release
      cd ../my_app_release
      rm -rf ../my_app_source
      bin/start

  However, this option can be expensive if you have multiple production
  nodes or if the release assembling process is a long one, as each node
  needs to individually assemble the release.

  You can automate this process in a couple different ways. One option
  is to make it part of your Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous
  Deployment (CD) pipeline. When you have a CI/CD pipeline, it is common
  that the machines in your CI/CD pipeline run on the exact same target
  triple as your production servers (if they don't, they should).
  In this case, you can assemble the release at the end of your CI/CD
  pipeline by calling `MIX_ENV=prod mix release` and push the artifict
  to S3 or any other network storage. To perform the deployment, your
  production machines can fetch the deployment from the network storage
  and run the `bin/start` script.

  Another mechanism to automate deployments is to use images, such as
  Amazon Machine Images, or container platforms, such as Docker.
  For instance, you can use Docker to run locally a system with the
  exact same target triple as your production servers. Inside the
  container, you can invoke `MIX_ENV=prod mix release` and build
  a complete image and/or container with the operating system, all
  dependencies as well as the releases.

  In other words, there are multiple ways systems can be deployed and
  releases can be automated and incorporated into all of them as long
  as you remember to build the system in the same target triple.

  Once a system is deployed, shutting down the system can be done by
  sending SIGINT/SIGTERM to the system, which is what most containers,
  platforms and tools do, or by explicitly invoking `bin/RELEASE_NAME stop`.
  Once the system receives the shutdown request, each application and
  their respective supervision trees will stop, one by one, in the
  opposite order that they were started.

  ## Options

  Inside each release, here are the built-in options:

    * `:applications` - a keyword list that configures and adds new applications
      to the release. The key is the application name and the value is one of:

        * `:permanent` - the application is started and the node shuts down
          if the application terminates, regardless of reason
        * `:transient` - the application is started and the node shuts down
          if the application terminates abnormally
        * `:temporary` - the application is started and the node does not
          shut down if the application terminates
        * `:load` - the application is only loaded
        * `:none` - the application is part of the release but it is neither loaded nor
          started

      All applications default to `:permanent`.

      It defaults to the current application and then we proceed to include all
      applications the current application depends on recursively. You can
      include new applications or change the mode of existing ones by listing
      them here.

      Releases assembled from an umbrella project require this configuration
      to be explicitly given.

    * `:strip_beams` - a boolean that controls if BEAM files should have their debug
      information, documentation chunks and other non-essential metadata removed.
      Defaults to `true`.

    * `:include_executables_for` - a list of atoms with executables to include on
      the release

    * `:cookie` - a string representing the Erlang Distribution cookie. If no cookie
      is set, one is automatically generated when the first release is assembled. The
      cookie will be written to `releases/COOKIE` and shared across multiple release
      versions. If you are setting this option manually, we recommend the cookie option
      to be a long and randomly generated, such as:
      `Base.url_encode64(:crypto.strong_rand_bytes(40))`. We also recommend to restrict
      the characters in the cookie to the subset returned by `Base.url_encode64/1`.

    * `:path` - the path the release should be installed to.
      Defaults to `"_build/MIX_ENV/rel/RELEASE_NAME"`.

    * `:version` - the release version as a string. Defaults to the current
      application version.

    * `:force` - a boolean that controls if conflicting operations should be
      always performed, without asking for confirmation before. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:quiet` - a boolean that controls if releases should write to the standard
      output its steps. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:include_erts` - a boolean indicating if the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS)
      should be included in the release. The default is `true`, which is also the
      recommended value. It may also be a path to an existing ERTS installation or
      an anonymous function of zero arity which should return any of the above.

      You may also set it to `false` if you desire to use the ERTS version installed
      on the target. Note, however, the ERTS version on the target must have THE EXACT
      VERSION as the ERTS version used when the release is assembled. Setting it to
      `false` also disables hot code upgrades. Therefore, `:include_erts` should be
      set to `false` with caution and only if you are assembling the release on the
      same server that runs it.

  ## Command line options

    * `--force` - forces files to be overridden
    * `--quiet` - do not write progress to the standard output
    * `--path` - the path of the release
    * `--version` - the version of the release
    * `--no-archives-check` - does not check archive
    * `--no-deps-check` - does not check dependencies
    * `--no-elixir-version-check` - does not check Elixir version
    * `--no-compile` - does not compile before assembling the release

  ## Umbrellas

  Releases are well integrated with umbrella projects, allowing you to
  release multiple subsets of your umbrellas child. The only difference
  between performing a release in the umbrella project compared to a
  regular application is that umbrellas require you to explicitly list
  your release and the starting point for each release. For example,
  imagine this umbrella applications:

      my_app_umbrella/
        apps/
          my_app_core/
          my_app_event_processing/
          my_app_web/

  where both `my_app_event_processing` and `my_app_web` depend on
  `my_app_core` but they do not depend on each other.

  Inside your umbrella, you can define multiple releases:

      releases: [
        web_and_event_processing: [
          applications: [
            my_app_event_processing: :permanent,
            my_app_web: :permanent
          ]
        ],

        web_only: [
          applications: [my_app_web: :permanent]
        ],

        event_processing_only: [
          applications: [my_app_event_processing: :permanent]
        ]
      ]

  Note you don't need to define all applications in `:applications`,
  only the entry points. Also remember that the recommended mode
  for all applications in the system is `:permanent`.

  Finally, keep in mind it is not required for you to assemble the
  release from the umbrella root. You can also assemble the release
  from each child application individually. Doing it from the root,
  however, allows you to include two applications that do not depend
  on each other as part of the same release.

  ## Build-time configuration and runtime configuration

  All of the configuration in your `config` directory is computed
  when the release is **assembled**. Therefore, if your configuration
  file does something like:

      config :my_app, :secret_key, System.get_env("MY_APP_SECRET_KEY")

  Releases will read said environment variables when the release is
  assembled and on the machine the release is assembled, and not before
  boot in your production servers. That's because the `config` directory
  is about build-time configuration.

  ## Internals

  This section covers some details about how releases are assembled.

  ### Structure of a release

  A release is orgnized as follows:

      bin/
        RELEASE_NAME
        start
      erts-ERTS_VSN/
      lib/
        APP_VSN/
          ebin/
          include/
          priv/
      releases
        RELEASE_VSN/
          elixir
          iex
          remote.boot
          remote.script
          start.boot
          start.script
          sys.config
          vm.args
        COOKIE
        start_erl.data

  ### Environment variables

  The system running under releases has the following environment variables set:

    * `RELEASE_ROOT` - points to the root of the release. In the system
      includes ERTS, then it is the same as `:code.root_dir/0`

    * `RELEASE_NAME` - the name of the release. It can be overridden when
      the release is started

    * `RELEASE_VSN` - the version of the release. It can be overridden when
      the release is started

    * `COOKIE` - the release COOKIE. It can be overridden when the release
      is started

  ### Hot Code Upgrades

  Erlang and Elixir are sometimes known for the capability of upgrading
  a node that is running in production without shutting down that node.
  However, this feature is not supported out of the box by Elixir releases.

  The reason we don't provide hot code upgrades is because they are very
  complicated to perform in practice, as they require careful coding of
  your processes and applications as well as extensive testing. Given most
  teams can use other techniques that are language agnostic to upgrade
  their systems, such as Blue/Green deployments, Canary deployments,
  Rolling deployments, and others, hot upgrades are rarely a viable
  option. Let's understand why.

  In a hot code upgrade, you want to update a node from version A to
  version B. To do so, the first step is to write recipes for every application
  that changed between those two releases, telling exactly how the application
  changed between versions, those recipes are called `.appup` files.
  While some of the steps in building `.appup` files can be automated,
  not all of them can. Furthermore, each process in the application needs
  to be explicitly coded with hot code upgrades in mind. Let's see an example.
  Imagine your application has a counter process as a GenServer:

      defmodule Counter do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def bump do
          GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :bump)
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(:ok) do
          {:ok, 0}
        end

        def handle_call(:bump, counter) do
          {:reply, :ok, counter + 1}
        end
      end

  You add this process as part of your supervision tree and ship version
  0.1.0 of your system. Now let's imagine that on version 0.2.0 you added
  two changes: instead of `bump/0`, that always increments the counter by
  one, you introduce `bump/1` that passes the exact value to bump the
  counter. You also change the state, because you want to store the maximum
  bump value:

      defmodule Counter do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def bump(by) do
          GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:bump, by})
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(:ok) do
          {:ok, {0, 0}}
        end

        def handle_call({:bump, by}, {counter, max}) do
          {:reply, :ok, {counter + by, max(max, by)}}
        end
      end

  If you to perform a hot code upgrade in such application, it would
  crash, because in the initial version the state was just a counter
  but in the new version the state is a tuple. Furthermore, you changed
  the format of the `call` message from `:bump` to  `{:bump, by}` and
  the process may have both old and new messages temporarily mixed, so
  we need to handle both. The final version would be:

     defmodule Counter do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(_) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def bump(by) do
          GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:bump, by})
        end

        ## Callbacks

        def init(:ok) do
          {:ok, {0, 0}}
        end

        def handle_call(:bump, {counter, max}) do
          {:reply, :ok, {counter + 1, max(max, 1)}}
        end

        def handle_call({:bump, by}, {counter, max}) do
          {:reply, :ok, {counter + by, max(max, by)}}
        end

        def code_change(_, counter, _) do
          {:ok, {counter, 0}}
        end
      end

  Now you can proceed to list this process in the `.appup` file and
  hot code upgrade it. This is one of the many steps one necessary
  to perform hot code upgrades and it must be taken into account by
  every process and application being upgraded in the system.
  The [`.appup` cookbook](http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/appup_cookbook.html)
  provides a good reference and more examples.

  Once `.appup`s are created, the next step is to create a `.relup`
  file with all instructions necessary to update the release itself.
  Erlang documentation does provide a chapter on
  [Creating and Upgrading a Target System](http://erlang.org/doc/system_principles/create_target.html).
  [Learn You Some Erlang has a chapter on hot code upgrades](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/relups).

  Overall, there are many steps, complexities and assumptions made
  during hot code upgrades, which is ultimately why they are not
  provided by Elixir out of the box. However, hot code upgrades can
  still be achieved by teams who desire to implement those steps
  on top of `mix release` in their projects or as separate libraries.
