  Loads and configures all registered apps.

  This is done by loading `config/runtime.exs` if one exists.

  ## Command line options

    * `--force` - forces compilation regardless of compilation times
    * `--temporary` - starts the application as temporary
    * `--permanent` - starts the application as permanent
    * `--preload-modules` - preloads all modules defined in applications
    * `--no-archives-check` - does not check archives
    * `--no-app-loading` - does not load applications (including from deps)
    * `--no-compile` - does not compile even if files require compilation
    * `--no-deps-check` - does not check dependencies
    * `--no-elixir-version-check` - does not check Elixir version
    * `--no-validate-compile-env` - does not validate the application compile environment
