  @doc """
  This behavior function receives a keyword list of `opts`
  and should return an updated list in case the SCM consumes
  the available options. For example, when a developer specifies
  a dependency:

      { "foo", "0.1.0", github: "foo/bar" }

  Each registered SCM will be asked if they consume this dependency,
  receiving [github: "foo/bar"] as argument. Since this option makes
  sense for the Git SCM, it will return an update list of options
  while other SCMs would simply return nil.

  This behavior function gets unchecked dependencies.
  If the dependency is locked, it receives the lock under the
  `:lock` key in `opts`. In case no lock is given, it must
  return a new lock (if one exists). If a lock is given,
  it must preferably return the same lock, but can return
  a different one in case of failure.

  This behavior function checks if the dependency is locked and
  the current repository version matches the lock. Note that some

  return true.
