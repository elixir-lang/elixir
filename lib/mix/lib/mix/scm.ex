  Returns a boolean if the dependency can be fetched

  defcallback format_lock(opts) :: String.t | nil

  @doc """
  This behaviour function receives a keyword list of `opts`
  and should return an updated list in case the SCM consumes
  the available options. For example, when a developer specifies
  a dependency:

      {:foo, "0.1.0", github: "foo/bar"}

  Each registered SCM will be asked if they consume this dependency,
  receiving `[github: "foo/bar"]` as argument. Since this option makes
  sense for the Git SCM, it will return an update list of options
  while other SCMs would simply return `nil`.

  defcallback checked_out?(opts) :: boolean

  @doc """
  This behaviour function checks out dependencies.

  If the dependency is locked, a lock is received in `opts`
  and the repository must be check out at the lock. Otherwise,
  no lock is given and the repository can be checked out
  to the latest version.

  It must return the current lock.
  """
  defcallback checkout(opts) :: any

  @doc """
  This behaviour function updates dependencies. It may be
  called by `deps.get` or `deps.update`.

  In the first scenario, a lock is received in `opts` and
  the repository must be updated to the lock. In the second,
  no lock is given and the repository can be updated freely.

  It must return the current lock.
  """
  defcallback update(opts) :: any

  @doc """
  This behaviour function checks the status of the lock. In
  particular, it checks if the revision stored in the lock
  is the same as the repository it is currently in. It may return:

    * `:mismatch` - if the lock doesn't match and we need to
      simply move to the latest lock

    * `:outdated` - the repository options are outdated in the
      lock and we need to trigger a full update

    * `:ok` - everything is fine

  The lock is sent via `opts[:lock]` but it may not always be
  available. In such cases, if the SCM requires a lock, it must
  return `:lockmismatch`, otherwise simply `:ok`.

  Note the lock may also belong to another SCM and as such, an
  structural check is required. A structural mismatch should always
  return `:outdated`.
