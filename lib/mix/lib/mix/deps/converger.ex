  # We traverse the tree of dependencies in a breadth-
  # first fashion. The reason for this is that we converge
  # dependencies, but allow the parent to override any
  # dependency in the child. Consider this tree with
  # dependencies `a`, `b`, etc and the order they are
  # converged:
  #
  #     * project
  #       1) a
  #       2) b
  #         4) d
  #       3) c
  #         5) e
  #         6) f
  #           7) d
  #
  # Notice that the `d` dependency exists as a child of `g`
  # and child of `f`. In case the dependency is the same,
  # we proceed. However, if there is a conflict, for instance
  # different git repositories is used as source in each, we
  # raise an exception.
  #
  # In order to solve such dependencies, we allow the project
  # to specify the same dependency, but it will be considered
  # to have higher priority:
  #
  #     * project
  #       1) a
  #       2) b
  #         5) d
  #       3) c
  #         6) e
  #         7) f
  #           8) d
  #       4) d
  #
  # Now, since `d` was specified in a parent project, no
  # exception is going to be raised since d is considered
  # to be the authorative source.
