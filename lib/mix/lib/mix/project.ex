defmodule Mix.Project do
  @moduledoc """
  A module that provides conveniences for defining and working
  with projects.

  ## Examples

  In order to configure Mix, a developer needs to use
  `Mix.Project` in a module and define a function named
  `project` that returns a keyword list with configuration.

      defmodule MyApp do
        use Mix.Project

        def project do
          [
            app: :my_app,
            vsn: "0.6.0"
          ]
        end
      end

  After being defined, the configuration for this project can be read
  as `Mix.project/0`. Notice that `config/0` won't fail if a
  project is not defined; this allows many mix tasks to work
  even without a project.

  In case the developer needs a project or wants to access a special
  function in the project, he can call `Mix.Project.get!/0`
  which fails with `Mix.NoProjectError` in case a project is not
  defined.
