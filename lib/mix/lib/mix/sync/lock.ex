  # Lock implementation working across multiple OS processes.
  #
  # The lock is implemented using TCP sockets and hard links.
  #
  # A process holds the lock if it owns a TCP socket, whose port is
  # written in the lock_0 file. We need to create such lock files
  # atomically, so the process first writes its port to a port_P
  # file and then attempts to create a hard link to it at lock_0.
  #
  # An inherent problem with lock files is that the lock owner may
  # terminate abruptly, leaving a "stale" file. Other processes can
  # detect a stale file by reading the port written in that file,
  # trying to connect to that port and failing. In order for another
  # process to link to the same path, the file needs to be replaced.
  # However, we need to guarantee that only a single process can
  # remove or replace the file, otherwise a concurrent process may
  # end up removing a newly linked file.
  #
  # To address this problem we employ a chained locking procedure.
  # Specifically, we attempt to link our port to lock_0, if that
  # fails, we try to connect to the lock_0 port. If we manage to
  # connect, it means the lock is taken, so we wait for it to close
  # and start over. If we fail to connect, it means the lock is stale,
  # so we want to replace it. In order to do that, we try to obtain
  # lock_1. Again, we try to link and connect. Eventually, we should
  # successfully link to lock_N. At that point we can clean up all
  # the files, so we perform these steps:
  #
  #   * move our port_P to lock_0
  #   * remove all the other port_P files
  #   * remove all lock_1+ files
  #
  # It is important to perform these steps in this order, to avoid
  # race conditions. By moving to lock_0, we make sure that all new
  # processes trying to lock will connect to our port. By removing
  # all port_P files we make sure that currently paused processes
  # that are about to link port_P at lock_N will fail to link, since
  # the port_P file will no longer exist (once lock_N is removed).
  #
  # Finally, note that we do not remove the lock file in `unlock/1`.
  # If we did that, another process could try to connect and fail
  # because the file would not exist, in such case the process would
  # assume the file is stale and needs to be replaced, therefore
  # possibly replacing another process who successfully links at the
  # empty spot. This means we effectively always leave a stale file,
  # however, in order to shortcut the port check for future processes,
  # we atomically replace the file content with port 0, to indicate
  # the file is stale.
  #
  # The main caveat of using ephemeral TCP ports is that they are not
  # unique. This creates a theoretical scenario where the lock holder
  # terminates abruptly and leaves its port in lock_0, then the port
  # is assigned to a unrelated process (unaware of the locking). To
  # handle this scenario, when we connect to a lock_N port, we expect
  # it to immediately send us `@probe_data`. If this does not happen
  # within `@probe_timeout_ms`, we assume the port is taken by an
  # unrelated process and the lock file is stale. Note that it is ok
  # to use a long timeout, because this scenario is very unlikely.
  # Theoretically, if an actual lock owner is not able to send the
  # probe data within the timeout, the lock will fail, however with
  # a high enough timeout, this should not be a problem in practice.

  Acquires a lock identified by the given key.

  This function blocks until the lock is acquired by this process,
  and then executes `fun`, returning its return value.

  This function can also be called if this process already has the
  lock. In such case the function is executed immediately.

  When the `MIX_OS_CONCURRENCY_LOCK` environment variable is set to
  a falsy value, the lock is ignored and the function is executed
  immediately.

  ## Options

    * `:on_taken` - a one-arity function called if the lock is held
      by a different process. The operating system PID of that process
      is given as the first argument (as a string). This function may
      be called multiple times, if the lock owner changes, until it
      is successfully acquired by this process.
