defmodule Mix.Task.Compiler do
  @moduledoc """
  This module defines the behaviour for a Mix task that does compilation.

  A Mix compiler task can be defined by simply using `Mix.Task.Compiler`
  in a module whose name starts with `Mix.Tasks.Compile.` and defining
  the [`run/1`](`c:run/1`) function:

      defmodule Mix.Tasks.Compile.MyLanguage do
        use Mix.Task.Compiler

        def run(_args) do
          :ok
        end
      end

  The [`run/1`](`c:run/1`) function returns an atom indicating the status of the
  compilation, and optionally can also return a list of "diagnostics"
  such as warnings or compilation errors. Doing this enables code
  editors to display issues inline without having to analyze the
  command-line output.

  If the compiler uses manifest files to track stale sources, it should
  define `manifests/0`, and if it writes any output to disk it should
  also define `clean/0`.

  A compiler supports the same attributes for configuration and
  documentation as a regular Mix task. See `Mix.Task` for more information.

  ## Listening to compilation

  When a running a long-lived Mix task you may want to detect compilations
  triggered in a separate OS process, for example, to reload the modules.
  In order to do that, the Mix project may configure listeners:

      def project do
        [
          ...,
          listeners: [SomeDep.MixListener]
        ]
      end

  or

      config :mix, :listeners, [SomeDep.MixListener]

  Each entry in the list must be either `t:Supervisor.module_spec/0` or
  `t:Supervisor.child_spec/0`. Additionally, the listener module must
  be defined in a dependency of the project, not the project itself.

  The listener process receives the following messages:

    * `{:modules_compiled, info}` - delivered after a set of modules is
      compiled. `info` is a map with the following keys:

        * `:app` - app which modules have been compiled.

        * `:build_scm` - the SCM module of the compiled project.

        * `:modules_diff` - information about the compiled modules. The
          value is a map with keys: `:added`, `:changed`, `:removed`,
          where each holds a list of modules. There is also a `:timestamp`
          key, which matches the modification time of all the compiled
          module files.

        * `:os_pid` - the operating system PID of the process that run
          the compilation. The value is a string and it can be compared
          with `System.pid/0` to determine if compilation happened in
          the same OS process as the listener.

  Note that the listener starts before any of the project apps are started.

  defmodule Diagnostic do
    @moduledoc """
    Diagnostic information such as a warning or compilation error.

    The file and position relate to where the diagnostic should be shown.
    If there is a file and position, then the diagnostic is precise
    and you can use the given file and position for generating snippets,
    IDEs annotations, and so on. An optional span is available with
    the line and column the diagnostic ends.

    Otherwise, a stacktrace may be given, which you can place your own
    heuristics to provide better reporting.

    The source field points to the source file the compiler tracked
    the error to. For example, a file `lib/foo.ex` may embed `.eex`
    templates from `lib/foo/bar.eex`. A syntax error on the EEx template
    will point to file `lib/foo/bar.eex` but the source is `lib/foo.ex`.
