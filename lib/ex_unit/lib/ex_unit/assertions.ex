defmodule ExUnit.Assertions do
  @moduledoc """
  This module contains a set of assertions functions that are
  imported by default into your test cases.

  In general, a developer will want to use the general
  `assert` macro in tests. The macro tries to be smart
  and provide good reporting whenever there is a failure.
  For example, `assert some_fun() == 10` will fail (assuming
  `some_fun()` returns 13):

      Expected 10 to be equal to 13

  This module also provides other small convenient functions
  like `assert_in_delta` and `assert_raise` to easily handle other
  common cases as checking a float number or handling exceptions.
