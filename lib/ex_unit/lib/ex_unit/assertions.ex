  This module contains a set of assertion functions that are
  imported by default into your test cases.

  In general, a developer will want to use the general
  `assert` macro in tests. This macro introspects your code
  and provide good reporting whenever there is a failure.
  For example, `assert some_fun() == 10` will fail (assuming
  `some_fun()` returns 13):

      Comparison (using ==) failed in:
      code: some_fun() == 10
      lhs:  13
      rhs:  10

  This module also provides other convenience functions
  like `assert_in_delta` and `assert_raise` to easily handle
  other common cases such as checking a floating point number
  or handling exceptions.
  """

  @doc """
  Asserts its argument is a truthy value.

  `assert` instrospects the underlying expression and provide
  good  reporting whenever there is a failure. For example,
  if the expression uses the comparison operator, the message
  will show the values of the two sides. The assertion

      assert 1+2+3+4 > 15

   will fail with the message:

      Assertion with > failed
      code: 1+2+3+4 > 15
      lhs:  10
      rhs:  15

  Similarly, if a match expression is given, it will report
  any failure in terms of that match. Given

      assert [one] = [two]

  you'll see:

      match (=) failed
      code: [one] = [two]
      rhs:  [2]

  Keep in mind that `assert` does not change its semantics
  based on the expression. In other words, the expression
  is still required to return a truthy value. For example,
  the following will fail:

      assert nil = some_function_that_returns_nil()

  Even though the match works, `assert` still expects a truth
  value. In such cases, simply use `Kernel.==/2` or
  `Kernel.match?/2`.
