defmodule IEx.Remsh do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides one helper function that is injected into connecting
  remote nodes to properly handle autocompletion. Elixir supports:

    * remsh from an elixir node to an elixir node
    * remsh from a plain erlang node to an elixir node (through the ^G menu)
    * remsh from an elixir node to a plain erlang node (and get an erl shell there)

  In order to get an Elixir shell from the ^G menu,
  you need to use 'Elixir-IEx' as the shell name.

  Connecting an Elixir shell to a remote node without
  Elixir is **not** supported.
