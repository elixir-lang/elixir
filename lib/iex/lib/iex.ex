defmodule IEx do
  @moduledoc %S"""
  Welcome to IEx.

  This module is the main entry point for Interactive Elixir and
  in this documentation we will talk a bit about how IEx works.

  Notice that some of the functionality described here will not be available
  depending on your terminal. In particular, if you get a message
  saying that the smart terminal could not be run, some of the
  features described here won't work.

  ## The Break command

  Inside IEx, hitting `Ctrl+C` will open up the `BREAK` menu. In this
  menu you can quit the shell, see process and ets tables information
  and much more.

  ## The User Switch command

  Besides the break command, one can type `Ctrl+G` to get to the
  user switch command menu. When reached, you can type `h` to
  get more information.

  In this menu, developers are able to start new shells and
  alternate between them. Let's give it a try:

      User switch command
       --> s 'Elixir.IEx'
       --> c

  The command above will start a new shell and connect to it.
  Create a new variable called `hello` and assign some value to it:

      hello = :world

  Now, let's roll back to the first shell:

      User switch command
       --> c 1

  Now, try to access the `hello` variable again:

      hello
      ** (UndefinedFunctionError) undefined function: IEx.Helpers.hello/0

  The command above fails because we have switched shells.
  Since shells are isolated from each other, you can't access the
  variables defined in one shell from the other one.

  The user switch command menu also allows developers to connect to remote
  shells using the `r` command. Keep in mind that you can't connect to a
  remote node if you haven't given a name to the current node
  (i.e. `Process.is_alive?` must return `true`).

  ## The .iex file

  When starting IEx, it will look for a local .iex file (located in the current
  working directory), then a global one (located at ~/.iex) and will load the
  first one it finds (if any). The code in the chosen .iex file will be
  evaluated in the shell's context. So, for instance, any modules that are
  loaded or variables that are bound in the .iex file will be available in the
  shell after it has booted.

  Sample contents of a local .iex file:

      # source another .iex file
      import_file "~/.iex"

      # print something before the shell starts
      IO.puts "hello world"

      # bind a variable that'll be accessible in the shell
      value = 13

  Running the shell in the directory where the above .iex file is located
  results in

      $ iex
      Erlang R15B03 (erts-5.9.3.1) [...]

      hello world
      Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
      iex(1)> value
      13

  It is possible to override the default loading sequence for .iex file by
  supplying the `--dot-iex` option to iex. See `iex --help`.

  ## Configuring the shell

  There are a number of customization options provided by the shell. Take a look
  at the docs for the `IEx.Options` module.

  The main functions there are `IEx.Options.get/1` and `IEx.Options.set/2`. One
  can also use `IEx.Options.list/0` to get the list of all supported options.
  `IEx.Options.print_help/1` will print documentation for the given option.

  In particular, it might be convenient to customize those options inside your
  .iex file like this:

      # .iex
      IEx.Options.set :inspect, limit: 3

      ### now run the shell ###

      $ iex
      Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [...]

      Interactive Elixir (0.9.1.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
      iex(1)> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      [1,2,3,...]

  ## Expressions in IEx

  As an interactive shell, IEx evaluates expressions. This has some
  interesting consequences that are worth discussing.

  The first one is that the code is truly evaluated and not compiled.
  This means that any benchmarking done in the shell is going to have
  skewed results. So never run any profiling nor benchmarks in the shell.

  Second, IEx allows you to break an expression into many lines,
  since this is common in Elixir. For example:

      iex(1)> "ab
      ...(1)> c"
      "ab\nc"

  In the example above, the shell will be expecting more input until it
  finds the closing quote. Sometimes it is not obvious which character
  the shell is expecting, and the user may find themselves trapped in
  the state of incomplete expression with no ability to terminate it other
  than by exiting the shell.

  For such cases, there is a special break-trigger (`#iex:break`) that when
  encountered on a line by itself will force the shell to break out of any
  pending expression and return to its normal state:

      iex(1)> ["ab
      ...(1)> c"
      ...(1)> "
      ...(1)> ]
      ...(1)> #iex:break
      ** (TokenMissingError) iex:1: incomplete expression
