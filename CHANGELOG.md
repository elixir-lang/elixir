# Changelog for Elixir v1.13

The focus behind Elixir v1.13 has been on tooling, mainly tooling related to code formatting, code fragments, code reflection, and code recompilation. A lot of this functionality will directly impact developers working on large codebases and provide meaningful quality of life improvements for those working on Elixir tooling and environments, such as IDEs, notebooks, etc.

## Semantic recompilation

Elixir v1.13 comes with many improvements to the compiler, so it recompiles your files less frequently. In particular:

  * The digest of the files are considered in addition to their size. This avoids recompiling many files when switching or rebasing branches.

  * Changing your `mix.exs` will no longer trigger a full recompilation, unless you specifically change the configurations used by the Elixir compiler (`:elixirc_paths` and `:elixirc_options`).

  * Changing compile-time configuration files (`config/config.exs` and any other file imported from it) now only recompiles the project files that depend on the reconfigured applications, instead of a full recompilation. However, if you change the configuration of your application itself, the whole project is still recompiled.

  * Adding, updating or removing a dependency now only recompiles the project files that depend on the modified a dependency.

  * If your project has both Erlang and Elixir files, changing an Erlang file will now recompile only the Elixir files that depend on it.

In a nutshell, Elixir went from triggering full recompilations whenever any of `mix.exs`, `config/config.exs`, `src/*`, and `mix.lock` changed on disk to semantic recompilations. Now it only fully recompiles when:

  * you change the compilation options in `mix.exs`
  * you change the configuration for the current project in `config/config.exs`

## mix xref

`mix xref` is a tool that analyzes relationships between files. By analyzing the compile-time and runtime dependencies between files, it allows developers to understand what files have to be recompiled whenever a file changes.

Elixir v1.13 comes with many improvements to `mix xref`, such as:

  * `mix xref graph` now supports `--label` to be set to "compile-direct" and "compile-connected", which returns the direct compile-time dependencies ("compile-direct") or just those that generate additional transitive dependencies ("compile-connected")

  * A new `mix xref trace FILE` subcommand receives a file and returns all dependencies in said file, including the line and what caused said dependency (a function/macro call, an alias, a struct, etc).

  * All `mix xref` subcommands support the `--fail-above` flag, which allows you to enforce your project has at most a certain number of compile-time cycles, transitive compile-time dependencies, etc.

  * `mix xref graph` now supports multiple `--sink` and `--source` to be given.

With these improvements, it has become simpler to understand the impact code recompilation has in our codebases and how to limit it.

## Code fragments

The `Code` module got a companion module called `Code.Fragment`, which hosts functions that work on incomplete code, as is often the scenario in editors, interactive shells, etc. The module contains different heuristics to analyze the source code and return context informational.

Thanks to these improvements, `IEx`' autocomplete got several quality of life improvements, such as the autocompletion of sigils, structs, and paths. For example, typing `~<TAB>` now shows:

```iex
iex(1)> ~
~C (sigil_C)    ~D (sigil_D)    ~N (sigil_N)    ~R (sigil_R)
~S (sigil_S)    ~T (sigil_T)    ~U (sigil_U)    ~W (sigil_W)
~c (sigil_c)    ~r (sigil_r)    ~s (sigil_s)    ~w (sigil_w)

```

Adding the sigil letter and pressing tab then shows the available delimiters:

```iex
iex(1)> ~r
"      """    '      '''    (      /      <      [      {      |

```

Similarly, `%<TAB>` now shows only the available structs (exceptions excluded), instead of all modules:

```elixir
iex(1)> %File.St
File.Stat      File.Stream
```

Finally, new compilation tracers have been added, alongside a handful of functions in `Module` to retrieve module metadata, which can be used to enrich suggestions in programming environments.

## Extended code formatting

The `mix format` task has been augmented with the notion of plugins. Plugins can teach the formatter how to format new files and how to format sigils, via the `Mix.Tasks.Format` behaviour.

For example, imagine that your project uses Markdown in two distinct ways: via a custom `~M` sigil and via files with the `.md` and `.markdown` extensions. A custom plugin would look like this:

```elixir
defmodule MixMarkdownFormatter do
  @behaviour Mix.Tasks.Format

  def features(_opts) do
    [sigils: [:M], extensions: [".md", ".markdown"]]
  end

  def format(contents, opts) do
    # logic that formats markdown
  end
end
```

Now any application can use your formatter as follows:

```elixir
# .formatters.exs
[
  # Define the desired plugins
  plugins: [MixMarkdownFormatter],
  # Remember to update the inputs list to include the new extensions
  inputs: ["{mix,.formatter}.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}", "posts/*.{md,markdown}"]
]
```

Finally, the `Code` module has also been augmented with two functions: `Code.string_to_quoted_with_comments/2` and `Code.quoted_to_algebra/2`. Those functions allow someone to retrieve the Elixir AST with their original source code comments, and then convert this AST to formatted code. In other words, those functions provide a wrapper around the Elixir Code Formatter, supporting developers who wish to create tools that directly manipulate and custom format Elixir source code.
