# Changelog for Elixir v1.14

Elixir v1.14 brings many improvements to the debugging experience in Elixir
and data-type inspection. It also includes a new abstraction for easy
partitioning of processes called `PartitionSupervisor`, as well as improved
compilation times and error messages.

Elixir v1.14 is the last version to support Erlang/OTP 23. Consider updating
to Erlang/OTP 24 or Erlang/OTP 25.

## `dbg`

`Kernel.dbg/2` is a new macro that's somewhat similar to `IO.inspect/2`, but
specifically tailored for **debugging**.

When called, it prints the value of whatever you pass to it, plus the debugged
code itself as well as its location. This code:

```elixir
# In my_file.exs
feature = %{name: :dbg, inspiration: "Rust"}
dbg(feature)
dbg(Map.put(feature, :in_version, "1.14.0"))
```

Prints this:

```shell
$ elixir my_file.exs
[my_file.exs:2: (file)]
feature #=> %{inspiration: "Rust", name: :dbg}

[my_file.exs:3: (file)]
Map.put(feature, :in_version, "1.14.0") #=> %{in_version: "1.14.0", inspiration: "Rust", name: :dbg}
```

`dbg/2` can do more. It's a macro, so it *understands Elixir code*. You can see
that when you pass a series of `|>` pipes to it. `dbg/2` will print the value
for every step of the pipeline. This code:

```elixir
# In dbg_pipes.exs
__ENV__.file
|> String.split("/", trim: true)
|> List.last()
|> File.exists?()
|> dbg()
```

Prints this:

```shell
$ elixir dbg_pipes.exs
[dbg_pipes.exs:5: (file)]
__ENV__.file #=> "/home/myuser/dbg_pipes.exs"
|> String.split("/", trim: true) #=> ["home", "myuser", "dbg_pipes.exs"]
|> List.last() #=> "dbg_pipes.exs"
|> File.exists?() #=> true
```

### IEx and Prying

`dbg/2` supports configurable backends. IEx automatically replaces the default
backend by one that halts the code execution with `IEx.Pry`, giving developers
the option to access local variables, imports, and more. This also works with
pipelines: if you pass a series of `|>` pipe calls to `dbg` (or pipe into it at the
end, like `|> dbg()`), you'll be able to step through every line in the pipeline.

You can keep the default behaviour by passing the `--no-pry` option to IEx.

## PartitionSupervisor

`PartitionSupervisor` is a new module that implements a new supervisor type. The
partition supervisor is designed to help with situations where you have a single
supervised process that becomes a bottleneck. If that process's state can be
easily partitioned, then you can use `PartitionSupervisor` to supervise multiple
isolated copies of that process running concurrently, each assigned its own
partition.

For example, imagine you have an `ErrorReporter` process that you use to report
errors to a monitoring service.

```elixir
# Application supervisor:
children = [
  # ...,
  ErrorReporter
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

As the concurrency of your application goes up, the `ErrorReporter` process
might receive requests from many other processes and eventually become a
bottleneck. In a case like this, it could help to spin up multiple copies of the
`ErrorReporter` process under a `PartitionSupervisor`.

```elixir
# Application supervisor
children = [
  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: ErrorReporter, name: Reporters}
]
```

The `PartitionSupervisor` will spin up a number of processes equal to
`System.schedulers_online()` by default (most often one per core). Now, when
routing requests to `ErrorReporter` processes we can use a `:via` tuple and
route the requests through the partition supervisor.

```elixir
partitioning_key = self()
ErrorReporter.report({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {Reporters, partitioning_key}}, error)
```

Using `self()` as the partitioning key here means that the same process will
always report errors to the same `ErrorReporter` process, ensuring a form of
back-pressure. You can use any term as the partitioning key.

### A Common Example

A common and practical example of a good use case for `PartitionSupervisor` is
partitioning something like a `DynamicSupervisor`. When starting many processes
under it, a dynamic supervisor can be a bottleneck, especially if said processes
take a long time to initialize. Instead of starting a single `DynamicSupervisor`,
you can start multiple:

```elixir
children = [
  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.DynamicSupervisors}
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

Now you start processes on the dynamic supervisor for the right partition.
For instance, you can partition by PID, like in the previous example:

```elixir
DynamicSupervisor.start_child(
  {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.DynamicSupervisors, self()}},
  my_child_specification
)
```

## Improved errors on binaries and evaluation

Erlang/OTP 25 improved errors on binary construction and evaluation. These improvements
apply to Elixir as well. Before v1.14, errors when constructing binaries would
often be hard-to-debug generic "argument errors". With Erlang/OTP 25 and Elixir v1.14,
more detail is provided for easier debugging. This work is part of [EEP
54](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0054).

Before:

```elixir
int = 1
bin = "foo"
int <> bin
#=> ** (ArgumentError) argument error
```

Now:

```elixir
int = 1
bin = "foo"
int <> bin
#=> ** (ArgumentError) construction of binary failed:
#=>    segment 1 of type 'binary':
#=>    expected a binary but got: 1
```

## Slicing with steps

Elixir v1.12 introduced **stepped ranges**, which are ranges where you can
specify the "step":

```elixir
Enum.to_list(1..10//3)
#=> [1, 4, 7, 10]
```

Stepped ranges are particularly useful for numerical operations involving
vectors and matrices (see [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx), for example).
However, the Elixir standard library was not making use of stepped ranges in its
APIs. Elixir v1.14 starts to take advantage of steps with support for stepped
ranges in a couple of functions. One of them is `Enum.slice/2`:

```elixir
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]
Enum.slice(letters, 0..5//2)
#=> ["a", "c", "e"]
```

`binary_slice/2` (and `binary_slice/3` for completeness) has been added to the
`Kernel` module, that works with bytes and also support stepped ranges:

```elixir
binary_slice("Elixir", 1..5//2)
#=> "lxr"
```

## Expression-based inspection and `Inspect` improvements

In Elixir, it's conventional to implement the `Inspect` protocol for opaque
structs so that they're inspected with a special notation, resembling this:

```elixir
MapSet.new([:apple, :banana])
#MapSet<[:apple, :banana]>
```

This is generally done when the struct content or part of it is private and the
`%name{...}` representation would reveal fields that are not part of the public
API.

The downside of the `#name<...>` convention is that *the inspected output is not
valid Elixir code*. For example, you cannot copy the inspected output and paste
it into an IEx session.

Elixir v1.14 changes the convention for some of the standard-library structs.
The `Inspect` implementation for those structs now returns a string with a valid
Elixir expression that recreates the struct when evaluated. In the `MapSet`
example above, this is what we have now:

```elixir
fruits = MapSet.new([:apple, :banana])
MapSet.put(fruits, :pear)
#=> MapSet.new([:apple, :banana, :pear])
```

The `MapSet.new/1` expression evaluates to exactly the struct that we're
inspecting. This allows us to hide the internals of `MapSet`, while keeping
it as valid Elixir code. This expression-based inspection has been
implemented for `Version.Requirement`, `MapSet`, and `Date.Range`.

Finally, we have improved the `Inspect` protocol for structs so that
fields are inspected in the order they are declared in `defstruct`.
The option `:optional` has also been added when deriving the `Inspect`
protocol, giving developers more control over the struct representation.
See the updated documentation for `Inspect` for a general rundown on
the approaches and options available.

## v1.14.4 (2023-04-03)

This release adds basic support for Erlang/OTP 26. When migrating
to Erlang/OTP 26, keep it mind it changes how maps are stored
internally and they will be printed and traversed in a different
order (note maps never provided a guarantee of their order).
To aid migration, this release adds `:sort_maps` to `inspect`
custom options, in case you want to sort them before inspection:

    inspect(map, custom_options: [sort_maps: true])
