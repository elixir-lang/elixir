# Changelog for Elixir v1.14

Elixir v1.14 requires Erlang/OTP 23+ with a small batch of new features
and the usual enhancements and bug fixes to Elixir and its standard library.
We cover the most notable changes next.

## PartitionSupervisor

`PartitionSupervisor` is a new module that implements a new supervisor type. The
partition supervisor is designed to help with situations where you have a single
supervised process that becomes a bottleneck. If that process's state can be
easily partitioned, then you can use `PartitionSupervisor` to supervise multiple
isolated copies of that process running concurrently, each assigned its own
partition.

For example, imagine you have a `ErrorReporter` process that you use to report
errors to a monitoring service.

```elixir
# Application supervisor:
children = [
  # ...,
  ErrorReporter
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

As the concurrency of your application goes up, the `ErrorReporter` process
might receive requests from many other processes and eventually become a
bottleneck. In a case like this, it could help to spin up multiple copies of the
`ErrorReporter` process under a `PartitionSupervisor`.

```elixir
# Application supervisor
children = [
  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: ErrorReporter, name: Reporters}
]
```

The `PartitionSupervisor` will spin up a number of processes equal to
`System.schedulers_online()` by default (most often one per core). Now, when
routing requests to `ErrorReporter` processes we can use a `:via` tuple and
route the requests through the partition supervisor.

```elixir
partitioning_key = self()
ErrorReporter.report({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {Reporters, partitioning_key}}, error)
```

Using `self()` as the partitioning key here means that the same process will
always report errors to the same `ErrorReporter` process, ensuring a form of
back-pressure. You can use any term as the partitioning key.

### A Common Example

A common and practical example of a good use case for `PartitionSupervisor` is
partitioning something like a `Task.Supervisor`. With many tasks under it, a
task supervisor can be a bottleneck. Instead of starting a single
`Task.Supervisor` for a set of tasks, you can start multiple ones:

```elixir
children = [
  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: Task.Supervisor, name: MyApp.TaskSupervisors}
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

Now you start tasks on the task supervisor for the right partition. For
instance, you can partition by PID, like in the previous example:

```elixir
Task.Supervisor.async(
  {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.TaskSupervisors, self()}},
  fn -> :do_some_work end
)
```
