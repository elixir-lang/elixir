This means users should have a better workflow when migrating in between environments

* Deprecations
  * [Kernel] `//` for default arguments is deprecated in favor of `\\`
  * [Kernel] Using `%` for sigils is deprecated in favor of `~`. This is a soft deprecation, no warnings will be emitted for it in this release

  * [Kernel] Limit sigils delimiters to one of the following: `<>`, `{}`, `[]`, `()`, `||`, `//`, `"` and `'`

  * [Set] Implementations of `difference/2`, `disjoint?/2`, `equal?/2`, `intersection/2`, `subset?/2` and `union/2` in `HashSet` are no longer polymorphic. To get polymorphism, use the functions in `Set` instead
