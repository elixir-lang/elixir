# Changelog for Elixir v1.18

Elixir v1.18 is an impressive release with improvements across the two main efforts happening within the Elixir ecosystem right now: set-theoretic types and language servers. It also comes with built-in JSON support and adds new capabilities to its unit testing library. Here is a quick break down.

## Type system improvements

The most exciting change in Elixir v1.18 is type checking of function calls, alongside gradual inference of patterns and return types. To understand how this will impact your programs, consider the following code:

```elixir
defmodule User do
  defstruct [:age, :car_choice]

  def drive(%User{age: age, car_choice: car}, cars_choices) when age >= 18 do
    if car in car_choices do
      {:ok, car}
    else
      {:error, :no_choice}
    end
  end

  def drive(%User{}, _car_choices) do
    {:error, :not_allowed}
  end
end
```

Elixir's type system will infer the `drive` function expects a `%User{}` struct as input and returns either `{:ok, dynamic()}`, `{:error, :no_choice}`, or `{:error, :not_allowed}`.

Therefore, the following code should emit a violation, due to an invalid argument:

```elixir
User.drive({:ok, %User{}}, car_choices)
```

Here is the warning:

```
    warning: incompatible types given to User.drive/2:

        User.drive({:ok, %User{age: nil, car_choice: nil}}, car_choices)

    given types:

        {:ok, %User{age: nil, car_choice: nil}}, empty_list()

    but expected one of:

        dynamic(%User{age: term(), car_choice: term()}), dynamic()

    where "car_choices" was given the type:

        # type: empty_list()
        # from: lib/foo.ex:21:17
        car_choices = []

    typing violation found at:
    │
 22 │     User.drive({:ok, %User{}}, car_choices)
    │          ~
    │
    └─ lib/foo.ex:22:10: Example.run/0
```

> The mismatched arguments are shown in red, if your terminal supports ANSI coloring.

And the next snippet will warn because the `:error` clause will never match, as that's not a valid return type of the `User.drive/2` call:

```elixir
case User.drive(user, car_choices) do
  {:ok, car} -> car
  :error -> Logger.error("User cannot drive")
end
```

And here is the warning:

```
    warning: the following clause will never match:

        :error

    because it attempts to match on the result of:

        User.drive(user, car_choices)

    which has type:

        dynamic({:ok, term()} or {:error, :no_choice} or {:error, :not_allowed})

    typing violation found at:
    │
 26 │       :error -> Logger.error("User cannot drive")
    │       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    │
    └─ lib/foo.ex:26: Example.run/0
```

For more details on typing inference and the trade-offs made by the Elixir team, [see our official documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.18/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html#type-inference).

There are many other improvements to the type system, which we will go in detail within the official release. Meanwhile, here is a list summary of the overall improvements done to the type system:

* Type inference of patterns (typing inference of guards will be part of an upcoming release)

* Type checking of all language constructs, including local and remote calls, except `for`, `with`, and closures

* Type checking of all functions inlined by the compiler found in `Kernel`

* Type checking of all conversion functions inlined by the compiler

* [Support for tuples and lists as composite types](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/08/28/typing-lists-and-tuples/) as well as type checking of their basic operations

* Detection of clauses and patterns that will never match from `case`, `cond`, and `=`

* Detection of unused clauses in private functions

## ExUnit improvements

ExUnit now supports parameterized tests to run the same test module multiple times under different parameters.

For example, Elixir ships a local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage called `Registry`. The registry can be partitioned and its implementation differs depending if partitioning is enabled or not. Therefore, during tests, we want to ensure both modes are exercised. With Elixir v1.18, we can achieve this by writing:

```elixir
defmodule Registry.Test do
  use ExUnit.Case,
    async: true,
    parameterize: [
      %{partitions: 1},
      %{partitions: 8}
    ]

  # ... the actual tests ...
end
```

ExUnit parameterizes whole test modules. If your modules are configured to run concurrently, as above, so will the parameterized ones.

ExUnit also comes with the ability of specifying test groups. While ExUnit supports running tests concurrently, those tests must not have shared state between them. However, in large applications, it may be common for some tests to depend on some shared state, and other tests to depend on a completely separate state. For example, part of your tests may depend on Cassandra, while others depend on Redis. Prior to Elixir v1.18, these tests could not run concurrently, but in v1.18 they might as long as they are assigned to different groups. Tests modules within the same group do not run concurrently, but across groups, they might.

With features like async tests, suite partitioning, and now grouping, Elixir developers have plenty of flexibility to make the most use of their machine resources, both in development and in CI.

## `mix format --migrate`

The `mix format` command now supports an explicit `--migrate` flag, which will convert constructs that have been deprecated in Elixir to their latest version. Because this flag rewrites the AST, it is not guaranteed the migrated format will always be valid when used in combination with macros that also perform AST rewriting.

As of this release, the following migrations are executed:

  * Normalize parens in bitstring modifiers - it removes unnecessary parentheses in known bitstring modifiers, for example `<<foo::binary()>>` becomes `<<foo::binary>>`, or adds parentheses for custom modifiers, where `<<foo::custom_type>>` becomes `<<foo::custom_type()>>`.

  * Charlists as sigils - formats charlists as `~c` sigils, for example `'foo'` becomes `~c"foo"`.

  * `unless` as negated `if`s - rewrites `unless` expressions using `if` with a negated condition, for example `unless foo do` becomes `if !foo do`.

More migrations may be added in future releases.

## JSON support

This release includes official support for JSON encoding and decoding.

Both encoder and decoder fully conform to [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) and
[ECMA 404](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/)
standards.

### Encoding

Encoding can be done via `JSON.encode!/1` and `JSON.encode_to_iodata!/1` functions.
The default encoding rules are applied as follows:

| **Elixir**             | **JSON** |
|------------------------|----------|
| `integer() \| float()` | Number   |
| `true \| false `       | Boolean  |
| `nil`                  | Null     |
| `binary()`             | String   |
| `atom()`               | String   |
| `list()`               | Array    |
| `%{binary() => _}`     | Object   |
| `%{atom() => _}`       | Object   |
| `%{integer() => _}`    | Object   |

You may also implement the `JSON.Encoder` protocol for custom data structures.
If you have a struct, you can derive the implementation of the `JSON.Encoder`
by specifying which fields should be encoded to JSON:

```elixir
  @derive {JSON.Encoder, only: [....]}
  defstruct ...
```

### Decoding

Decoding can be done via `JSON.decode/2` and `JSON.decode!/2` functions.
The default decoding rules are applied as follows:

| **JSON** | **Elixir**             |
|----------|------------------------|
| Number   | `integer() \| float()` |
| Boolean  | `true \| false`        |
| Null     | `nil`                  |
| String   | `binary()`             |
| Object   | `%{binary() => _}`     |

## Potential incompatibilities

This release no longer supports WERL (a graphical user interface on Windows used by Erlang 25 and earlier). For a better user experience on Windows terminals, use Erlang/OTP 26+ (this is also the last Elixir release to support Erlang/OTP 25).

Furthermore, in order to support inference of patterns, Elixir will raise if it finds recursive variable definitions. This means patterns that never match, such as this one, will no longer compile:

    def foo(x = {:ok, y}, x = y)

However, recursion of root variables (where variables directly point to each other), will also fail to compile:

    def foo(x = y, y = z, z = x)

While the definition above could succeed (as long as all three arguments are equal), the cycle is not necessary and could be removed, as below:

    def foo(x = y, y = z, z)

You may also prefer to write using guards:

    def foo(x, y, z) when x == y and y == z

## v1.18.0-dev

### 1. Enhancements

#### Elixir

  * [CLI] Add experimental PowerShell scripts for `elixir`, `elixirc`, and `mix` on Windows. Those provide a safer entry point for running Elixir from other platforms
  * [Calendar] Add `Duration.to_string/1`
  * [Code] Support several migration options in `Code.format_string!/2`
  * [Code] Add parenthesis around `--` and `---` in `Code.format_string!/2` to make precedence clearer
  * [Code] Include more metadata in `Code.string_to_quoted/2` when `token_metadata: true` to help compute ranges from the AST
  * [Code.Fragment] Have `:capture_arg` as its own entry in `Code.Fragment.surround_context/2`

  * [Enumerable] Add `Enum.product_by/2` and `Enum.sum_by/2`
  * [Exception] Add `MissingApplicationsError` exception to denote missing applications
  * [Kernel] Update source code parsing to match [UTS #55](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr55/) latest recommendations. In particular, mixed script is allowed in identifiers as long as they are separate by underscores (`_`), such as `http_сервер`. Previously allowed highly restrictive identifiers, which mixed Latin and other scripts, such as the japanese word for t-shirt, `Tシャツ`, now require the underscore as well

### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)

#### Elixir

  * [Inspect.Algebra] `color/3` is deprecated in favor of `color_doc/3`
  * [Inspect.Algebra] `fold_doc/2` is deprecated in favor of `fold/2`

  * [EEx] `c:EEx.handle_text/2` is deprecated in favor of `c:EEx.handle_text/3`

#### Elixir

  * [Code] Setting `:warnings_as_errors` is deprecated via `Code.put_compiler_option/2`. This must not affect developers, as the `:warnings_as_errors` option is managed by Mix tasks, and not directly used via the `Code` module
  * [Enumerable] Deprecate returning a two-arity function in `Enumerable.slice/1`
  * [List] `List.zip/1` is deprecated in favor of `Enum.zip/1`
