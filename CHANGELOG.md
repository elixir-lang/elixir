# Changelog for Elixir v1.7

Elixir v1.7 is the last release to support Erlang/OTP 19. We recommend everyone to migrate to Erlang/OTP 20+.

## The `__STACKTRACE__` construct

Erlang/OTP 21.0 introduces a new way to retrieve the stacktrace that is lexically scoped and no longer relies on side-effects like `System.stacktrace/0` does. Before one would write:

```elixir
try do
  ... something that may fail ...
rescue
  e ->
    log(e, System.stacktrace())
    reraise(e, System.stacktrace())
end
```

In Elixir v1.7, this can be written as:

```elixir
try do
  ... something that may fail ...
rescue
  e ->
    log(e, __STACKTRACE__)
    reraise(e, __STACKTRACE__)
end
```

This change may also yield performance improvements in the future, since the lexical scope allows us to track precisely when a stacktrace is used and we no longer need to keep references to stacktrace entries after the `try` construct finishes.

Other parts of the exception system have been improved. For example, more information is provided in certain occurrences of `ArgumentError`, `ArithmeticError` and `KeyError` messages.

## Erlang/OTP logger integration

Erlang/OTP 21 includes a new `:logger` module. Elixir v1.7 fully integrates with the new `:logger` and leverages its metadata system. The `Logger.Translator` mechanism has also been improved to export metadata, allowing custom Logger backends to leverage information such as:

  * `:crash_reason` - a two-element tuple with the throw/error/exit reason as first argument and the stacktrace as second

  * `:initial_call` - the initial call that started the process

  * `:registered_name` - the process registered name as an atom

We recommend Elixir libraries that previously hooked into Erlang's `:error_logger` to hook into `Logger` instead, in order to support all current and future Erlang/OTP versions.

## Other Logger improvements

Previously, Logger macros such as `debug`, `info`, and so on would always evaluate its arguments, even when nothing would be logged. From Elixir v1.7, the arguments are only evaluated when the message is logged.

The Logger configuration system also accepts a new option called `:compile_time_purge_matching` that allows you to remove log calls with specific compile-time metadata. For example, to remove all logger calls from application `:foo` with level lower than `:info`, as well as remove all logger calls from `Bar.foo/3`, you can use the following configuration:

```elixir
config :logger,
  compile_time_purge_matching: [
    [application: :foo, level_lower_than: :info],
    [module: Bar, function: "foo/3"]
  ]
```

## ExUnit improvements

ExUnit has also seen its own share of improvements. Assertions such as `assert some_fun(arg1, arg2, arg3)` will now include the value of each argument in the failure report:

```elixir
  1) test function call arguments (TestOneOfEach)
     lib/ex_unit/examples/one_of_each.exs:157
     Expected truthy, got false
     code: assert some_vars(1 + 2, 3 + 4)
     arguments:

         # 1
         3

         # 2
         7

     stacktrace:
       lib/ex_unit/examples/one_of_each.exs:158: (test)
```

Furthermore, failures in doctests are now colored and diffed.

On the `mix test` side of things, there is a new `--failed` flag that runs all tests that failed in the previous run. Finally, coverage reports generated with `mix test --cover` include a summary out of the box:

```
Generating cover results ...

  * [Kernel] Raise on unsafe variables in order to allow us to better track unused variables
  * [Kernel] Warn when using `length` to check if a list is not empty on guards
  * [Kernel] Add hints on mismatched `do`/`end` and others pairs

  * [Regex] Include endianness in the regex version. This allows regexes to be recompiled when an archive is installed in a system with a different endianness
  * [Registry] Add `Registry.count/1` and `Registry.count_match/4`
  * [String] Update to Unicode 11
  * [System] Use ISO 8601 in `System.build_info/0`

  * [Kernel] `not left in right` is ambiguous and is deprecated in favor of `left not in right`
  * [Kernel] Warn on confusing operator sequences, such as `1+++1` meaning `1 ++ +1` or `........` meaning `... .. ...`
