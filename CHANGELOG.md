# Changelog for Elixir v1.5

Elixir v1.5 brings new features, enhancements and bug fixes to Elixir. It is the first release to leverage features added as part of Erlang/OTP 20. It is also the last release that supports Erlang/OTP 18.

## UTF-8 atoms, function names and variables

Elixir v1.5 supports non-quoted atoms and variables to be in UTF-8 when using Erlang/OTP 20+. For example:

    test "こんにちは世界" do
      assert :こんにちは世界
    end

Or:

    saudação = "Bom dia!"

Elixir follows the recommendations in [Unicode Annex #31](http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/) to make the language more accessible to other languages and communities. Identifiers must still be a sequence of letters, followed by digits and combining marks. This means symbols, such as mathematical notations and emoji, are not allowed identifiers.

For a complete reference on Elixir syntax, see the [Syntax Reference](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/syntax-reference.html). For technical details on Unicode support, see [Unicode Syntax](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/unicode-syntax.html).

## Exception.blame

`Exception.blame/3` is a new function in Elixir that is capable of attaching debug information to certain exceptions. Currently this is used to augment `FunctionClauseError`s with a summary of all clauses and which parts of clause match and which ones didn't. For example:

    iex> Access.fetch(:foo, :bar)
    ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Access.fetch/2

    The following arguments were given to Access.fetch/2:

        # 1
        :foo

        # 2
        :bar

    Attempted function clauses (showing 5 out of 5):

        def fetch(-%struct{} = container-, key)
        def fetch(map, key) when -is_map(map)-
        def fetch(list, key) when -is_list(list)- and is_atom(key)
        def fetch(list, key) when -is_list(list)-
        def fetch(-nil-, _key)

    (elixir) lib/access.ex:261: Access.fetch/2

In the example above, an argument that did not match or guard that did not evaluate to true are shown between `-`. If the terminal supports ANSI coloring, they are wrapped in red instead of the `-` character.

Since blaming an exception can be expensive, `Exception.blame/3` must be used exclusively in debugging situations. It is not advised to apply it to production components such as a Logger. This feature has been integrated into the compiler, the command line, ExUnit and IEx.

This feature also requires Erlang/OTP 20+.

## Streamlined child specs

Elixir v1.5 streamlines how supervisors are defined and used in Elixir. Elixir now allows child specifications, which specify how a child process is supervised, to be defined in modules. In previous versions, a project using Phoenix would write:

    import Supervisor.Spec

    children = [
      supervisor(MyApp.Repo, []),
      supervisor(MyApp.Endpoint, [])
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

In Elixir v1.5, one might do:

    children = [
      MyApp.Repo,
      MyApp.Endpoint
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

The above works by calling the `child_spec/1` function on the given modules.

This new approach allows `MyApp.Repo` and `MyApp.Endpoint` to control how they run under a supervisor. This reduces the chances of mistakes being made, such as starting an Ecto repository as a worker or forgetting to declare that tasks are temporary in a supervision tree.

If it is necessary to configure any of the children, such can be done by passing a tuple instead of an atom:

    children = [
      {MyApp.Repo, url: "ecto://localhost:4567/my_dev"},
      MyApp.Endpoint
    ]

The modules `Agent`, `Registry`, `Task`, and `Task.Supervisor` have been updated to include a `child_spec/1` function, allowing them to be used directly in a supervision tree similar to the examples above. `use Agent`, `use GenServer`, `use Supervisor`, and `use Task` have also been updated to automatically define an overridable `child_spec/1` function.

Finally, child specifications are now provided as maps (data-structures) instead of the previous `Supervisor.Spec.worker/3` and `Supervisor.Spec.supervisor/3` APIs. This behaviour also aligns with how supervisors are configured in Erlang/OTP 18+. See the updated `Supervisor` docs for more information, as well as the new `Supervisor.init/2` and `Supervisor.child_spec/2` functions.

## @impl

This release also allows developers to mark which functions in a given module are an implementation of a callback. For example, when using the [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) project, one needs to implement both `init/1` and `call/2` when writing a Plug:

    defmodule MyApp do
      @behaviour Plug

      def init(_opts) do
        opts
      end

      def call(conn, _opts) do
        Plug.Conn.send_resp(conn, 200, "hello world")
      end
    end

The problem with the approach above is that, once more and more functions are added to the `MyApp` module, it becomes increasingly harder to know the purposes of the `init/1` and `call/2` functions. For example, for a developer unfamiliar with Plug, are those functions part of the `MyApp` API or are they implementations of a given callback?

Elixir v1.5 introduces the `@impl` attribute, which allows us to mark that certain functions are implementation of callbacks:

    defmodule MyApp do
      @behaviour Plug

      @impl true
      def init(_opts) do
        opts
      end

      @impl true
      def call(conn, _opts) do
        Plug.Conn.send_resp(conn, 200, "hello world")
      end
    end

You may even use `@impl Plug` if you want to explicitly document which behaviour defines the callback you are implementing.

Overall, using `@impl` has the following advantages:

  * Readability of the code is increased, as it is now clear which functions are part of your API and which ones are callback implementations. To reinforce this idea, `@impl true` automatically marks the function as `@doc false`, disabling documentation unless `@doc` is explicitly set

  * If you define `@impl` before a function that is not a callback, Elixir will error. This is useful in case of typos or in case the behaviour definition changes (such as a new major version of a library you depend on is released)

  * If you use `@impl` in one implementation, Elixir will force you to declare `@impl` for all other implementations in the same module, keeping your modules consistent

## Calendar improvements

This release brings further improvements to Calendar types. It adds arithmetic and others functions to `Time`, `Date`, `NaiveDateTime` and `Datetime` as well as conversion between different calendars.
