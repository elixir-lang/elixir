# Changelog for Elixir v1.4

Elixir v1.4 brings new features, enhancements and bug fixes into Elixir. The most notable changes are the addition of the `Registry` module and the `Task.async_stream/3` and `Task.async_stream/5` which aid developers in writing concurrent software. Those two features and a couple other improvements are described in detail below followed by the complete list of changes.

## Registry

The registry is a local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage:

  * Local because keys and values are only accessible to the current node (opposite to distributed)
  * Decentralized because there is no single entity responsible for managing the registry
  * Scalable because performance scales linearly with the addition of more cores upon partitioning

A registry is chosen upon start to have unique or duplicate keys. Every key-value pair is associated to the process registering the key. Keys are automatically removed once the owner process terminates.

    iex> Registry.start_link(:unique, MyRegistry)
    iex> {:ok, _} = Registry.register(MyRegistry, "hello", 1)
    iex> Registry.lookup(MyRegistry, "hello")
    [{self(), 1}]

With the registry, developers can provide dynamic process names, module-function dispatch or even a local pubsub system. See the `Registry` documentation for more information.

## Syntax coloring

Elixir v1.4 introduces the ability to syntax color inspected data structures:

    iex> IO.puts inspect([hello: 1, world: "!"], syntax_colors: [atom: :cyan])
    [hello: 1, world: "!"]

Coloring is done with ANSI colors as specified in the `IO.ANSI` module.

IEx automatically relies on this feature to provide syntax coloring for evaluated shell results. This behaviour can be configured via the `:syntax_colors` coloring option:

    IEx.configure [colors: [syntax_colors: [atom: :cyan, string: :green]]]

To disable coloring altogether, pass an empty list to `:syntax_colors`.

## Calendar

Elixir v1.3 introduced new calendar types. This release continues evolving the Calendar APIs by adding functions for comparing, adding and calculating the difference between types, retrieve the `day_of_week/1`, check if the current date is a `leap_year?/1` and more.

## Task.async_stream

When there is a need to traverse a collection of items concurrently, Elixir developers often resort to tasks:

    collection
    |> Enum.map(&Task.async(SomeMod, :function, [&1]))
    |> Enum.map(&Task.await/1)

While the snippet above works fine in many occasions, for large collections it will spawn and run concurrently as many tasks as there are items in the collection.

`Task.async_stream/3` and `Task.async_stream/5` allows developers to process collections concurrently while controlling the maximum amount of concurrent tasks:

    collection
    |> Task.async_stream(SomeMod, :function, [], max_concurrency: System.schedulers_online)

The `Task.async_stream` functions are also lazy, allowing developers to partially consume the stream until a condition is reached. Furthermore, `Task.Supervisor.async_stream/4` and `Task.Supervisor.async_stream/6` can be used to ensure the concurrent tasks are spawned under a given supervisor.

## Application inference

Mix v1.4 now automatically infers the list of applications that are required on runtime from your dependencies list.

In previous Mix versions, most of your dependencies had to be added both to your dependencies list and applications list. Here is how a `mix.exs` would look like:

    def application do
      [applications: [:logger, :plug, :postgrex]]
    end

    def deps do
      [{:plug, "~> 1.2"},
       {:postgrex, "~> 1.0"}]
    end

This was error prone as many developers would not list their dependencies in their applications list.

Mix v1.4 now automatically infers your applications list as long as you leave the `:applications` key empty. The `mix.exs` above can be rewritten to:

    def application do
      [extra_applications: [:logger]]
    end

    def deps do
      [{:plug, "~> 1.2"},
       {:postgrex, "~> 1.0"}]
    end

With the above, Mix will automatically build your application list based on your dependencies. Applications that are part of Erlang or Elixir that are required at runtime, such as `:logger`, must be added to the `:extra_applications` list. All extra applications will be included in the application list.

Finally, if there is a dependency you don't want to include in the application runtime list, you can do so by specifying the `runtime: false` option:

    {:distillery, "> 0.0.0", runtime: false}

We hope this feature provides a more streamlined workflow for developers who are building releases for their Elixir projects.

## Mix install from SCM

Mix v1.4 can now install escripts and archives from both Git and Hex, providing you with even more options for distributing Elixir code.

This makes it possible to distribute CLI applications written in Elixir by publishing a package which builds an escript to Hex. [`ex_doc`](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_doc) has been updated to serve as an example of how to use this new functionality.

Simply running:

    mix escript.install hex ex_doc

will fetch `ex_doc` and its dependencies, build them, and then install `ex_doc` to `~/.mix/escripts` (by default). After adding `~.mix/escripts` to your `PATH`, running `ex_doc` is as simple as:

    ex_doc

You can now also install archives from Hex in this way. Since they are fetched and built on the user's machine, they do not have the same limitations as pre-built archives.

It is also possible to install escripts and archives by providing a Git/GitHub repo. See `mix help escript.install` and `mix help archive.install` for more details.
