### 2. Bug fixes

#### Elixir

  * [Float] Avoid multiple roundings in `Float.{ceil/2, floor/2, round/2}`
  * [Kernel] Don't crash in `macro_exported?/3` when dealing with Erlang modules
  * [Kernel.SpecialForms] Produce meaningful warning when with's else clauses have no effect
  * [Macro] Wrap fn calls in parens in `Macro.to_string/2`
  * [Macro] Do not print aliases as keys inside keyword lists in `Macro.to_string/2`
  * [Stream] Ensure `Stream.take/2` does not consume next element on `:suspend`
  * [String] Fix infinite recursion in `String.replace_leading/3` and `String.replace_trailing/3` when given an empty string
  * [Task] Fix `Task.shutdown/1,2` infinite block when task has no monitor

#### ExUnit

  * [ExUnit] Fix a race condition in `assert_receive` where we would assert a message was not received but show it in the list of messages when the message is delivered right after the timeout value

### Mix

  * [Mix.Dep] Use `gmake` on FreeBSD instead of `make` when compiling make dependencies
  * [Mix.Project] Only copy files from source when they're newer than destination (for Windows machines)
  * [Mix.Task] Ensure non-recursive tasks inside umbrella are reenabled

### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)

#### Elixir

  * [Enum] `Enum.partition/2` has been deprecated in favor of `Enum.split_with/2`
  * [System] Deprecate plural time units in favor of singular ones to align with future Erlang releases

### 4. Deprecations

#### Elixir

  * [Behaviour] The `Behaviour` module is deprecated. Callbacks may now be defined directly via the `@callback` attribute
  * [Enum] Deprecate `Enum.uniq/2` in favor of `Enum.uniq_by/2`
  * [Float] `Float.to_char_list/2` and `Float.to_string/2` are deprecated (use the :erlang functions if such conversions are desired)
  * [Kernel] Deprecate support for making private functions overridable. Overridable functions must always be public as they must be contracts
  * [Kernel] Warn if variable is used as a function call
  * [OptionParser] Deprecate aliases with multiple letters, such as `-abc`
  * [Stream] Deprecate `Stream.uniq/2` in favor of `Stream.uniq_by/2`

#### IEx

  * [IEx.Helpers] `import_file/2` is deprecated in favor of `import_file_if_available/1`

#### Mix

  * [Mix.Utils] `underscore/1` and `camelize/1` are deprecated
